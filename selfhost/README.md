# Run TilinX Engine With Docker

This image runs the TilinX host in its local profile and spawns pi runtimes in
the same container. Use it two ways:

| Use | Engine URL | Token |
|---|---|---|
| Local Docker on your machine | `http://127.0.0.1:4318` | whatever you pass as `TILINX_HOST_TOKEN` |
| Remote VPS with Caddy TLS | `https://your-domain.example/engine` | `TILINX_HOST_TOKEN` from `selfhost/.env` |

> How this works: the **host** (`packages/host/src/local/main.ts`) is
> already a server — the desktop just spawns it as a loopback sidecar. Self-host
> is the same binary with `TILINX_HOST_BIND=0.0.0.0`, a persistent volume, and a
> TLS reverse proxy in front. It lazily spawns one `pi` runtime per agent **inside
> the container** over loopback, exactly like the desktop. That's the convergence
> paying off: "local = the cloud shrunk to one machine" is literally the same code.

Do not publish port `4318` on a remote VPS. The compose setup keeps it private
and exposes only Caddy on ports `80` and `443`.

## Local Usage

Run these from the repo root, for example `~/dev/tilinx`.

```sh
docker build -f selfhost/Dockerfile -t tilinx/self-host:local .

docker run --rm -d --name tilinx-engine \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -e TILINX_HOST_TOKEN=test \
  -v tilinx-data:/data \
  tilinx/self-host:local
```

Verify the engine:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:4318/health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test" http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/capabilities
```

## Managed Engine Pod Target

TilinX's managed deployment runs this same open host/runtime stack as
Kubernetes engine pods, without Caddy. Local process code execution runs inside
each single-user container:

```sh
docker build \
  -f selfhost/Dockerfile \
  --target engine-pod \
  -t tilinx/engine-pod:local .
```

Run it locally like the pod template does:

```sh
docker run --rm -d --name tilinx-engine-pod \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -e TILINX_HOST_TOKEN=test \
  -v tilinx-engine-pod-data:/data \
  tilinx/engine-pod:local
```

Verify:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:4318/health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test" http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/capabilities
```

Expected capabilities include `"codeExecution":"local-bash"` and
`"amazon-bedrock"` in `providers`. `integrations` reflects what you configured:
it lists `"composio"` only when the container has a `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`
(platform-mode Composio — create a free project at composio.dev and pass
`-e COMPOSIO_API_KEY=...`; the single-user pod acts as one Composio `user_id`).
Without the key, integrations are simply off (`"integrations":[]`). A managed
deployment supplies `TILINX_HOST_TOKEN`, mounts `/data` on the user's persistent
volume, and fronts the pod with authenticated proxying.

### Published GHCR Image

The manual GitHub Actions workflow **TS Engine Image** publishes this same
`engine-pod` target as a multi-arch image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) to:

```text
ghcr.io/gettilinx/tilinx-engine-pod
```

Run it from Actions only when you want a new image:

1. GitHub → Actions → TS Engine Image → Run workflow.
2. Pick an optional tag. A `sha-<commit>` tag is always published.
3. Leave `publish_latest` on if `:latest` should move to this build.

This uses GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), not Google Container Registry (GCR).
After the first run, make the GHCR package public in GitHub package settings if
Google Cloud or a local machine should pull it without credentials. A public GHCR
package can stay public even while the source repo is private.

Verify the published manifest list for any tag, including the automatic
`sha-<commit>` tag:

```sh
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/gettilinx/tilinx-engine-pod:<tag>
```

Expected output includes both platforms:

```text
Platform:    linux/amd64
Platform:    linux/arm64
```

On Apple Silicon, verify the native pull works without `--platform`:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/gettilinx/tilinx-engine-pod:<tag>
```

Local pull/run:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/gettilinx/tilinx-engine-pod:latest

docker run --rm -d --name tilinx-engine-pod \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -e TILINX_HOST_TOKEN=test \
  -v tilinx-engine-pod-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/gettilinx/tilinx-engine-pod:latest
```

For Google Cloud, prefer a public GHCR package. If the package stays private,
use an authenticated pull path such as a GKE image pull secret or an Artifact
Registry mirror/remote repository.

Watch live engine logs:

```sh
docker logs -f --tail=200 tilinx-engine
```

Stop local Docker engine:

```sh
docker stop tilinx-engine
```

Clean slate: `docker rmi tilinx/self-host:local && docker volume rm tilinx-data`.

### Local Desktop Client

Create or edit repo-root `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4318
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN=test
```

Run desktop from `app/`:

```sh
cd app
pnpm start
```

Restart the desktop app after editing `.env.local`. The terminal should say it is
in `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL` host mode and is skipping the Rust sidecar.

### Local Web Client

Run from `packages/web/`:

```sh
cd packages/web
VITE_NEW_ENGINE=1 \
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4318 \
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN=test \
pnpm dev
```

Open the Vite URL it prints.

## Remote VPS Usage

Prereqs:

- Linux VPS with Docker and Docker Compose plugin.
- Domain A/AAAA record pointing at the VPS.
- Ports `80` and `443` open.

Run these on the VPS:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gettilinx/tilinx
cd tilinx/selfhost
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `selfhost/.env`:

```env
TILINX_DOMAIN=tilinx.example.com
TILINX_HOST_TOKEN=<run openssl rand -hex 32>
# Optional: app integrations (Gmail, Slack…) via your own Composio project
# key (platform mode; free tier at composio.dev). Omit → integrations off.
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=
```

Start the engine and Caddy:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Watch live engine logs from `tilinx/selfhost`:

```sh
docker compose logs -f --tail=200 host
```

If you are not in `tilinx/selfhost`, pass the compose file:

```sh
docker compose -f /path/to/tilinx/selfhost/docker-compose.yml logs -f --tail=200 host
```

Verify from any machine:

```sh
curl https://tilinx.example.com/engine/health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://tilinx.example.com/engine/v1/capabilities
```

### Remote Desktop Client

On the machine running the desktop app, edit repo-root `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL=https://tilinx.example.com/engine
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN=<token>
```

Run desktop from `app/`:

```sh
cd app
pnpm start
```

### Remote Web Client, Served From The VPS

Run on the VPS from repo root `tilinx/`:

```sh
pnpm install
VITE_NEW_ENGINE=1 pnpm --filter tilinx-web build
mkdir -p selfhost/web
cp -R packages/web/dist/. selfhost/web/
cd selfhost
docker compose restart caddy
```

Open `https://tilinx.example.com`. Enter:

```text
Engine URL: https://tilinx.example.com/engine
Token: <token>
```

### Remote Web Client, Run Locally

Run on your local machine from `packages/web/`:

```sh
cd packages/web
VITE_NEW_ENGINE=1 \
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL=https://tilinx.example.com/engine \
VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN=<token> \
pnpm dev
```

Open the Vite URL it prints.

## Operations

Run compose commands from `tilinx/selfhost` on the VPS.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Logs | `docker compose logs -f --tail=200 host` |
| Stop | `docker compose down` |
| Update | `git pull && docker compose up -d --build` |
| Backup | `docker run --rm -v selfhost_tilinx-data:/d -v "$PWD":/b alpine tar czf /b/tilinx-backup.tgz -C /d .` |

All state lives in the Docker volume mounted at `/data`: workspaces, agents,
skills, routines, and provider credentials.

Security: the token gates every route that reads or changes user data. Public
metadata routes include `/engine/health`, `/engine/v1/version`,
`/engine/v1/capabilities`, and `/engine/v1/catalog`. Treat the token like a
password. On a VPS, expose Caddy only, never port `4318` directly. Because you
supply `TILINX_HOST_TOKEN` via env, the host redacts it in its
`TILINX_HOST_LISTENING` boot banner (you see `token_fp=…` + `token_len=…`, not
the value) so the credential never lands in `docker compose logs`.
