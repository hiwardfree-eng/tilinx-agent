 * exports the LIVE store the turn machinery publishes into. This stub exists so
 * the unaliased package (the app's typecheck resolution, and any third-party
 * import) presents the same surface. It never receives a publish; it dies with
 * this package's client at the v1-client deletion.

 * Shape-compatible with `@tilinx/sdk`'s `SnapshotSource` — kept dependency-free
 * on purpose (this package has no deps).
