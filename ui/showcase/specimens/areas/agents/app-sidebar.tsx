Add an `icon` to a group and `defaultGroup` for the trailing block, and each block becomes a team: one header row, then its agents. Every example below is live; select, fold and drag them."

The team row itself is one hit target — glyph, name, triangle and rollup badge together — and nothing sits beside it. Its glyph is monochrome on purpose: the identity colour in that column belongs to the agent avatars one indent to the right."

          title="States"
          note="Selection is one paint for every kind of row: a team header and an agent row wear the same pill, so “where am I” reads the same whichever is open. Folding a team hides everything under it — its header keeps the pill and picks up a rollup badge, so the rail never goes dark on the question. Rows carry no menu at all: a team's name and mark are changed in the host's own dialog, and an agent is renamed, recoloured, moved and deleted on its focused agent screen, so the rail keeps one door onto each and its full width for names."
