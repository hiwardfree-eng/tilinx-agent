/**
 * RoutineRowTitle — a row's name line.
 *
 * It stopped being one string the moment a list could span several agents: a
 * cross-agent surface (a team's Routines) passes an OWNER chip, and "whose
 * routine is this" is as load-bearing there as what the routine is called. So
 * the name truncates and the chip never does. A single-agent list passes no
 * chip and the line is exactly the paragraph it always was.
 *
 * A second, rarer chip rides the same line: a WARNING the surface supplies when
 * this routine cannot run as configured (its AI account is disconnected or out
 * of credits). It sits after the owner chip and, like it, never truncates —
 * a warning that gets cut off is not a warning.
