/**
 * The rail's row anatomy, defined ONCE.
 *
 * EVERY interactive line in the sidebar is the same row: the top-level
 * destinations above the list, the band that names the list, each team's
 * header, each team's destination rows, each agent, and the "New agent" row
 * that closes it. They differ only in what they point at and how far their
 * glyph is indented. If any of them drifts in height, indent, glyph column or
 * type size, the rail stops reading as one list and starts reading as several
 * stacked ones. So every value lives here and nowhere else, and
 * {@link SidebarRowButton} is the only component that spends them.
 *
 * Five invariants worth stating, because each was a bug before it was a rule:
 *
 * 1. **Height is FIXED on every row** (`h-7`, 28px). No hover, active, focus or
 *    badge state may change it — a rail that reflows under the cursor is the
 *    single most obvious tell of a hand-built list.
 * 2. **The paint is a LAYER, the content sits on top of it.** Hover and active
 *    are drawn on the row's own `::before` — an inset, rounded pill (see
 *    {@link sidebarRowFill}) — never on the element that carries the geometry.
 *    That split is the whole reason the pill can be inset without dragging the
 *    glyph column 6px to the right with it: the indent is spent inside a
 *    full-width button that the paint knows nothing about, so the pills form
 *    one clean column and hierarchy stays a matter of indent, never of a ragged
 *    left edge.
 * 3. **Colour is never pinned on the glyph.** A row's icon inherits its label's
 *    colour, so an active row brightens as one object rather than as a label
 *    with a stale grey mark beside it.
 * 4. **ONE weight for the whole rail.** Every line — nav destination, band,
 *    team header, child row, agent, add row — is set at 510, the notch past
 *    medium that Linear's rails use. Weight is therefore never a variable: not
 *    of depth, not of state, so nothing re-measures or reflows on click, and
 *    hierarchy is carried entirely by indent and colour. See
 *    `font-weight-510` in `@tilinx-ai/core`'s globals for why 510 is spelled
 *    the way it is.
 * 5. **Two type sizes and no more.** Every row that points at something is
 *    13px; the band that names the list is 12px. See {@link sidebarRowType}.
 * 6. **One horizontal inset for every band and every run of rows.** See
 *    {@link sidebarBandInset}.

/**
 * The ONE horizontal inset the rail's contents sit on: every band heading and
 * every run of rows a band names, and nothing else in the rail may add another.
 *
 * It lives here because it was a bug first. `SidebarNavList` put `px-2` on its
 * `<nav>` AND `SidebarBand` put `px-2` on its heading, so "My accounts" and
 * "Workspace" were inset twice while "Your teams" — rendered from `sidebar.tsx`
 * inside an unpadded wrapper — was inset once. The three bands' child ROWS all
 * sat on 8px, so only the three labels drifted: two of the rail's three
 * headings hung 8px right of the third, which reads as two lists that happen to
 * be stacked rather than one rail. Spending the value from one export is what
 * makes that unrepeatable: a consumer cannot double it without doubling this.

 *
 * **`ICON_GAP` — glyph column to label. TIGHT (6px).** What the eye measures is
 * glyph EDGE to first letter, which is this margin PLUS the slack the mark
 * leaves inside the 20px box: an agent's avatar fills it (0), a 16px Lucide
 * mark leaves 2px a side, a 14px team mark 3px. 6px puts the optical distance
 * at 6-9px, Linear's own range; 8px put it at 8-11px and a label read as
 * drifting away from its own icon.
 *
 * **`TRAILING_GAP` — label to the badge on its right. COMFORTABLE (8px).** A
 * count or a status dot is a separate object from the name, not part of the
 * phrase, so it needs air the icon does not: the icon and the label are ONE
 * thing being read left to right.
 *
 * Both spent once, here, so a nav destination, a team header, an agent, the add
 * row and the footer row cannot drift into different gaps.

/**

 *
 * - `item` — 13px, worn by EVERY row that points at something: the top-level
 *   destinations, a team header, a team's destination rows, an agent, the
 *   "new" row. One size, so the rail reads as one list.
 * - `band` — 12px, for the one row that names the list instead of pointing at
 *   anything ("Your teams").
 *
 * Both steps carry the SAME weight (`font-weight-510`, see invariant 4), so
 * the only thing that separates the band from the rows it heads is one step of
 * size and its colour. That is deliberate: a band set apart by weight reads as
 * a heading bolted above a list, and the whole point of this rail is that the
 * band is the list's own first line.
 *
 * Line-heights are set explicitly and both are shorter than the 28px row, so
 * the label sits optically centred in the box and descenders survive the
 * label's `overflow: hidden` truncation (a `leading-none` label clips the tail
 * of a "g").
