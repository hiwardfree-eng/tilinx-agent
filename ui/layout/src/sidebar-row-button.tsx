 *
 * The anatomy it owns, left to right: a fixed-height box (28px, and no state
 * may change it), a 20px glyph column, a truncating label, an optional trailing
 * slot inside the button, and an optional affordance beside it. Plus exactly
 * two behaviours, which are the only two a rail row ever has:
 *
 * - **activate** — `onActivate`, and when `active` the pill plus
 *   `aria-current="page"`;
 * - **disclose** — `disclosure`, which adds the rotating triangle after the
 *   label, `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.
 *
 * A row can be BOTH: a collapsed team block discloses its contents and is
 * simultaneously the active row, standing in for the destination row it is
 * hiding.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT own: the icon-only collapsed rail, which is a
 * different anatomy with flyouts rather than a narrower version of this one.
