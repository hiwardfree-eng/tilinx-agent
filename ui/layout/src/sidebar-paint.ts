/**
 * The rail's PAINT LAYER: one inset, rounded pill drawn behind every row.
 *
 * Radius and inset live HERE and in no other string, which is the point. A
 * fill spanning the rail edge to edge is a bar, not a pill: at 28px tall and
 * 204px wide an 8px corner is invisible, and the rail reads as a stack of
 * rectangles rather than as macOS/Linear-style rows floating on a surface.
 * Pulling the paint 6px in from each side is what makes the corner legible, and
 * `rounded-lg` is the SAME radius the team screen's section lozenges wear, so
 * the two selected-things in the product are one shape.
 *
 * It is a `::before` and not the row's own background because the row is also
 * what carries the geometry: inset the element and the glyph column moves with
 * it (invariant 2). A pseudo-element paints, spans nothing and pushes nothing,
 * so the indent is untouched by construction. Its siblings (the button, the
 * "..." affordance) are positioned so they paint ON TOP of it — the pseudo is
 * positioned, and a positioned box beats static content in the painting order.
 *
 * The FOCUS RING rides the same layer, scoped to the row's own button (`>
 * button:first-child`), so it traces the pill exactly rather than a rectangle
 * 12px wider than the fill it is meant to be outlining. The affordance beside
 * it keeps its own ring: it is a separate control, not part of the row's pill.
