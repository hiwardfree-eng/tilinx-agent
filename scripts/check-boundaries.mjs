/**
 * Keeps "TilinX" (this repo) cloud-free. The CLOSED control plane
 * (`@tilinx/host-cloud` — the concrete cloud adapters pg / GCS / GKE / Redis /
 * BigQuery, the operator-admin surface, and the cloud `main.ts`) was RETIRED
 * and deleted: the shipped cloud is a private gateway plus one engine pod per
 * agent running this repo's open host/runtime, so the multi-tenant host was an
 * architecture TilinX moved past (it remains in git history). See BOUNDARY.md
 * for the manifest this script enforces.
 *
 *   - Every package here is OPEN: every `packages/*` workspace package
 *     (enumerated dynamically, so a brand-new package is covered the day it
 *     appears) plus the `ui/` React packages. None of them may EVER import a
 *     cloud lib or `@tilinx/host-cloud`. Staying cloud-lib-free is what keeps
 *     this code deployment-agnostic (desktop, engine pod, self-host).
 *
 * Three protections, all fail the build (exit 1):
 *
 *   Rule A — no OPEN-package file reaches the closed package or a cloud lib. A
 *     reach is ANY of:
 *       (a) a bare `@tilinx/host-cloud` (or subpath) specifier;
 *       (b) a relative/absolute import that resolves under the closed package's
 *           former `packages/host-cloud/` path — a deep-relative specifier like
 *           `../../host-cloud/src/...` never contains the bare package name, so
 *           it would slip past a bare-spec match;
 *       (c) a known cloud lib (the CLOUD_LIBS denylist);
 *       (d) an UNDECLARED bare import — a specifier that is not a node/bun builtin
 *           and not a dependency of the importing file's own package.json. This is
 *           the allowlist half: a future cloud dep the denylist has never heard of
 *           (a novel `@vendor/db`) cannot be imported without first being declared,
 *           where Rule C then sees it.
 *     The ONE documented exception is the runtime's own cloud adapter
 *     (`packages/runtime/src/turn/gcs-store.ts`), reachable only from the runtime's
 *     wiring point (`packages/runtime/src/main.ts`) — the same port+adapter+wiring
 *     shape one level down. Those two files may import `@google-cloud/storage`.
 *
 *   Rule B — `packages/host-cloud/` must NOT exist here. It was retired and
 *     deleted; anything reappearing under that path would silently re-publish
 *     closed code. Local build leftovers (a gitignored node_modules/ or dist/
 *     that survives a branch switch on a dev machine) are tolerated — only
 *     real content under the path fails.
 *
 *   Rule C (manifest) — no OPEN package may DECLARE the closed package or a cloud
 *     lib as a dependency (any bucket). This is the allowlist direction the seam
 *     wants: a denylist of import specifiers lets a new cloud dep leak green by
 *     default, but a dependency must be declared to resolve, and a declaration is
 *     a small, reviewable surface. The runtime's `@google-cloud/storage` is the
 *     one documented exception.
 *
 * No new npm deps: a regex import extractor (comments stripped first) over
 * .ts/.tsx + node:fs.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-boundaries.mjs   (root script: pnpm check:boundaries)
