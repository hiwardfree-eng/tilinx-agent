 * On a non-spaces multiplayer host (legacy Teams v2, exactly one org) there is
 * no personal/team split, so `activeSpaceIsTeam` is irrelevant and behavior is
 * unchanged — the gate falls through to the members-roster rule.
 *
 * That base rule is exactly the members-roster gate (`canSeeMembers` is already
 * "multiplayer AND owner|admin": `orgRole` returns null off-multiplayer and the
 * least-privileged `user` otherwise), so the dashboard and the roster share one
 * source of truth. The gateway is the real enforcer; this only hides an
