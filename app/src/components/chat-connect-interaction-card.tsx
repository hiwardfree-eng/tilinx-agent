/**

 * (via its `renderConnect` prop, wired with the `StepChrome` the stepper hands
 * it — the header pager + dismiss X). Following the reference "Coworker card"
 * language, the modal TITLE is the app's real brand logo beside the explicit
 * action, "Connect Google Sheets", at regular weight. The body carries the
 * agent's REASON ("To create the spreadsheet in your Drive.") in foreground
 * tone. A right-aligned footer carries the
 * unified quiet "Not now" + Esc hint beside the single filled "Connect" pill
 * (with a return-key glyph).
 *
 * Enter connects, Esc declines (matching the footer hints), both ignored while
 * focus sits in a text field so the real composer is unaffected. The header
 * pager owns Back/Forward, so a REVISITED step needs no navigation button of its
 * own: already connected -> the calm "Connected" state and no footer; skipped ->
 * the Connect CTA (and its paired "Not now") return so the user can reconsider
 * and connect after all. "Not now" travels WITH the Connect CTA so the decline
 * affordance is present wherever connecting is offered — never a dead-end step
 * with only a Connect button.
 *
 * While the OAuth hand-off is in flight the pill shows the connecting state and
 * a quiet line reminds the user the browser is waiting. On the live frontier an
 * already-connected toolkit self-reports through `onConnected` (see {@link
 * useIntegrationConnect}) so the sequence never soft-locks.
