/**
 * Turning several agents' half-built routines into rows of ONE list.
 *
 * A routine that is still being set up in chat exists only as an unclaimed
 * setup ACTIVITY — it is not a routine yet, so no routines read can see it.
 * The list has to carry those drafts as their own resumable rows, or a routine
 * started from this surface disappears the moment the person looks away from
 * its chat, under a grid still claiming "nothing runs on its own yet".
 *
 * The rule that finds a draft is the SHARED one
 * (`findDraftSetupActivities` — current and legacy sentinels, unclaimed,
 * unarchived), so the two surfaces can never disagree about what a draft is.
 * Only the keying is new: activity ids are unique per AGENT, so rows are
 * namespaced with the same {@link teamRoutineKey} the routine rows use.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free, unit tested in `app/tests/team-routine-drafts-model.test.ts`.
