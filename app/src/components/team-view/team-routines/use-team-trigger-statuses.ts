/**
 * The team Routines section's trigger read: a fan-out over the per-agent key
 * every trigger-health read uses (`["agent-trigger-status", <agentId>]`, built
 * from `agentTriggerStatusQueryOptions`), then the shared view model
 * (`useTriggerStatusViewModel`).
 *
 * This exists because the merged grid renders `RoutineTriggerStatus` for every
 * row with a trigger binding, and a row handed no status resolves to the muted
 * "Verifying trigger…" chip — forever. A cross-agent list that cannot resolve
 * that chip is making a claim it can never settle, so it has to run the whole
 * per-agent machinery, timeout included.
 *
 * Three rules the fan-out keeps:
 *
 * - **No aggregate key.** One agent's trigger status has ONE cache entry, so no
 *   two readers can serve different truths and opening a team costs nothing for
 *   agents already warm.
 * - **Enabled per agent only when that agent HAS an event routine** — the ONE
 *   rule, `triggerBoundRoutineIds`. A workspace with no event routines makes
 *   zero extra requests. The bounded poll (`triggerStatusPollInterval`, inside the shared
 *   options) rides along: it is what makes a settling trigger settle, and it
 *   stops once every trigger has, so it is not a storm.
 * - **No toast, ever.** `useAgentTriggerStatus` toasts through
 *   `useQueryErrorToast`; N agents would become N toasts. Nothing is swallowed
 *   though: a failed read is NAMED, folded into the section's existing
 *   `AgentReadsFailed` strip rather than a second strip of its own, because
 *   "TilinX could not read this agent" is the same fact whichever of the
 *   section's reads produced it, and retry is the loud user-initiated path.
 *
 * `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` is set per observer here, like the section's
 * other fan-outs, and the results are reduced through `teamFanOut` for the same
 * reason: the shared view model memoizes on the items it is handed, and a fresh
 * array every render would re-arm its verification timeout every render.
