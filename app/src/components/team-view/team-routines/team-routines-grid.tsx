 * sibling of that trio.
 *
 * Its own file because the grid is where a CROSS-agent list stops looking like
 * a per-agent one: every map it takes (last runs, drafts, trigger statuses,
 * owner chips) is keyed by the merged list's row keys, and the wording of its
 * empty state depends on how many owners are in view and whether anyone
 * answered at all. Reading `team-routines.tsx` should not mean reading that.
 *
 * Everything it shows is decided above it: it takes the section's hooks whole,
 * typed off their return types, and owns no state. Only the labels are its own
 * (pure `t()` reads), so the section above carries none of the wording.
