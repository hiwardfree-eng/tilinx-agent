/**
 * The Routines section's own tools: how many routines this team has, and the
 * one thing you came here to do. Two forms, and the CALLER never picks — the
 * team chrome measures its strip and says which is honest for the width
 * (`team-chrome-tools.tsx`).
 *
 * - **`strip`**: the third zone of the one-row team strip. The count and the
 *   create button, and NO "Routines" title: the lit tab three inches to the
 *   left already said that word, and saying it twice on one line is the
 *   crowding this layout exists to undo.
 * - **`row`**: the two-row fallback — a slim band with the title, the count,
 *   and the button at its right edge.
 *
 * Its agent dropdown is back, but it is a different control: a SECTION-LOCAL
 * filter (`TeamAgentFilterCapsule`), not the team-wide pin. Narrowing this
 * list no longer narrows the board the user returns to, which is why a tab
 * click always opens Routines team-wide.
 *
 * The create button steps aside in either form when the grid is showing its
 * EMPTY state, which carries the same button: two identical filled pills on
 * one screen is not a choice the user has, it is the same act twice. The
 * caller decides, by passing no button — the grid stops being empty the moment
 * a DRAFT row lands, and the header takes the button back then.
