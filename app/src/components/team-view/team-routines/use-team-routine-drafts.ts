 *
 * It exists because a routine being built in chat is not a routine yet — it is
 * an unclaimed setup ACTIVITY, invisible to every routines read. The list has to
 * carry those as their own resumable rows, or a routine started from this
 * surface vanishes from the list the moment the person looks away from its
 * chat, under a grid still saying nothing runs on its own yet.
 *
 * Same three rules as the section's other fan-outs: no aggregate key (so the
 * tab and this list share one cache entry and one invalidation),
 * `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` per observer (an alt-tab must not re-sweep
 * every pod), and failures NAMED rather than swallowed — folded into the
 * section's one strip, with retry scoped to the agents that failed.
