/**
 * The team strip: WHERE you are, WHERE you can go, and — when the width is
 * there — what this section gives you to work with.
 *
 * **Wide, one row, two zones:**
 *
 *     (glyph Marketing › (helmet) Kai)(Routines)(Files)(Archived)(focused agent screen)      [search][Everyone ▾][New task]
 *      \\_________________________ left cluster _________________________/             \\________ right, the section's ________/
 *
 * **The team IS the first lozenge.** There is no separate breadcrumb and no
 * "Tasks" label anywhere: the board is not a section beside the team, it is
 * what the team looks like when you are on it. So the team's glyph and name
 * wear the same lozenge geometry as its sections, take the same active state
 * (`teamHomeLozengeActive`), and carry the screen's `<h1>`. A pinned agent
 * grows a second segment inside that lozenge — chevron, helmet, name — and the
 * lozenge simply gets wider, the way a Safari tab does.
 *
 * Its click has three arms and they are the RAIL's arms, one grammar on two
 * surfaces (`lib/team-home-lozenge.ts`): elsewhere in the team it opens the
 * board with the pin riding along; on a narrowed board it clears the pin; on
 * the whole team's board it does nothing.
 *
 * The second segment appears only where the pin actually narrows what is on
 * screen (`sectionHonorsAgentPin`): the board. Files starts at every agent,
 * while the other sections carry their own scope or list the whole team, so
 * the lozenge is the team alone — showing a segment there would claim a
 * narrowing the user never set, and offer to clear a pin nothing is using.
 *
 * **Narrow:** the cluster first collapses into the identity lozenge. Only below
 * `TEAM_STRIP_COMPACT_MIN` do the tools take their own row. Both thresholds are
 * measured in `team-chrome-layout.ts`, so neither form is squeezed into space
 * it does not honestly have.
