/**
 * A team's ARCHIVE: everything this team has finished with.
 *
 * It is a MODE of the Tasks section, not a destination of its own. The active
 * board's toolbar carries an "Archived" button (`teamView.archive.open`) that
 * swaps this screen in, and this screen's toolbar carries "Back to tasks"
 * (`teamView.archive.back`) to swap it back out. `TeamMissionControl` owns the
 * flag both buttons flip, so the archive can hand the user back at any time by
 * calling `onShowActive` — which is exactly what a mission that turns out to be
 * ACTIVE does below.
 *
 * The one-sweep rule holds. It reads the SAME `all-conversations` query
 * every other Mission Control surface reads, over the FULL workspace roster,
 * and narrows what it renders through the shared `MissionControlScope`
 * (`useTeamBoardScope`) — never a second key for the team's slice.
