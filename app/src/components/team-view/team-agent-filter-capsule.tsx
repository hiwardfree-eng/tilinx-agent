/**
 * "Whose work am I looking at" — for ONE section, owned by that section.
 *
 * Routines and the archive each render one of these in the strip's right zone,
 * beside their other controls, in the same 32px ghost capsule the person
 * filter wears: the whole zone is one row of Safari capsules and a filter must
 * not read as a different species of control from the filter next to it.
 *
 * **Its state is the SECTION's, not the team's.** It is a plain `useState`
 * where it is mounted, deliberately NOT the store's `teamAgentFilter`: that
 * pin is the RAIL's act — clicking an agent means "show me this agent's
 * board" — and letting a section's own dropdown write it made narrowing one
 * list silently narrow every other surface the team has, including the one the
 * user would return to. Tabs therefore always open a section team-wide, which
 * is the honest default for a list whose whole job is to aggregate.
 *
 * Props only: no store, no capabilities. The caller holds the state and says
 * what the choices are.
