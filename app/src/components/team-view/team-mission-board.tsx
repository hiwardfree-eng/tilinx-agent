 * (`useTeamBoardScope`). The agent filter inside that scope is CONTROLLED by
 * the store, so clicking an agent row in the sidebar and picking one from the
 * board's own filter menu are the same act.
 *
 * The source is handed the FULL agent roster and told which slice to show, so
 * every team reads the one cross-agent sweep rather than starting its own.
 *
 * This board is the whole of a kept-alive top-level screen, so it rides
 * `MissionBoard`'s own `useIsActiveView` signal to release the shell detail
 * panel when the team view hides (HOU-1165). That covers the ACTIVE board
 * only; the Archived SECTION carries its own release, in
 * `MissionControlArchived`.
