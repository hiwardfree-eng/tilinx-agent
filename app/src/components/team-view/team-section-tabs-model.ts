 * from one section of a team to another. Its contents are
 * `visibleTeamSectionsForTeam(caps, team)` in order, MINUS the board: the
 * board's lozenge is the team itself (glyph, name, and the pinned agent), so
 * it carries no label of its own and the word "Tasks" appears nowhere in the
 * chrome. One list still decides what a team offers this caller, and both the
 * strip and the view behind it read it, so a lozenge can never open a section
 * the view refuses to render (or hide one it would).
 *
 * The mapping is an exhaustive `Record`, so adding a `TeamSectionId` without
 * naming it is a compile error rather than a tab with a blank label.
 *
 * Pure, and unit-tested in `app/tests/team-section-tabs-model.test.ts`.
