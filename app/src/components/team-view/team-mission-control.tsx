/**
 * A team's Tasks section: the team's active board, or the honest empty state
 * when the team holds no agents.
 *
 * The ARCHIVE is a MODE of this section (`team-archived.tsx`), reached by the
 * board toolbar's "Archived" button on desktop and by the drilled header's
 * "…" menu on the phone, and left by the archive's own "Back to tasks". The
 * flag lives here, above both boards, so exactly one of them is mounted and
 * neither has to say which of two things it is.
 *
 * The FULL workspace roster goes to the board (so it reads the single warm
 * `all-conversations` query, per the one-sweep rule) and the shared
 * `MissionControlScope` narrows what it renders.
 *
 * Mounted with the team's id as its key, so switching teams starts a clean
 * board instead of carrying the previous team's selection across.
