 * Which agent a team surface is narrowed to, in the two vocabularies the app
 * speaks. They differ on purpose: a filter is CHOSEN by agent (the rail's row,
 * a section's own dropdown), so it is held as an agent id, while a mission
 * board FILTERS on a folder path — the key every mission card carries. The
 * translation runs one way only, id to path, because every control that PICKS
 * the filter picks an agent; a board reads the answer and never writes it.
 *
 * The same translation serves the store's team-wide pin (the board) and a
 * section's own local filter (Routines, Archived), because the question is the
 * same shape either way; only who owns the answer differs.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free so it is unit-tested
 * (`app/tests/team-agent-filter-model.test.ts`).
