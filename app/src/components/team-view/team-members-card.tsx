/**
 * The people of a server-owned team (C13), under the team's agents: who joined

 *
 * The list is the team's EXPLICIT membership rows and nothing else, which is
 * why it always ships with the admin note: the space's owners and managers run
 * every team without ever holding a row, so a roster read on its own would
 * claim a team nobody is in charge of. The default team goes further and has no
 * rows to read at all, so it says why instead of showing an empty list.
 *
 * In a PERSONAL space the card does not exist. One human is in it, so there is
 * nobody to list or manage, and the three member-management routes are the only
 * thing the gateway refuses there (`403 personal_space`) — the teams themselves
 * are as usable as in any other space. `teamMembersView` owns that decision.
 *
 * Every write here is owner-only and every one of them can still be refused by
 * the gateway, which is the real enforcer; the mutation hooks already own that
 * surface (an expected refusal is an informational toast, anything else the red
 * report-bug one), so nothing in this file handles an error except the READ,
 * whose failure would otherwise read as "this team is empty".
