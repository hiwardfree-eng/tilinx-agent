 * doors (Team Settings, and Settings > Permissions in multiplayer). It names
 * its rail from here, so a section can never mean two different things or be
 * gated two different ways. The per-agent Context / Admin tabs that used to
 * render their own one-group rails from `contextTabGroups` / `adminTabGroups`
 * went away with the agent tab shell, and so did those builders.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free, so the visibility rules are unit-tested
 * (`app/tests/agent-settings-nav.test.ts`).
