/**
 * The foot of the rail: the Academy, Settings, and the help control beside
 * Settings.
 *
 * **The Academy leads the cluster.** Learning to fly is neither a destination
 * the user reaches for hourly nor a preference, so it closes the rail rather
 * than competing with the Assistant and the Agent Store at the top of it —
 * and it sits directly above Settings, where the two rows a person opens
 * about their own use of TilinX are found together
 * (`sidebar-nav-rows.tsx` builds the row; the phone's More menu draws the
 * same one at the tail of its destinations).
 *
 * **Settings lives here, not in the "Workspace" band.** That band is what the
 * SPACE is made of, and it is owner territory; Settings belongs to the
 * PERSON's chrome, which is why it sits with the account. It also has to be
 * reachable in every deployment mode, including the ones where the Workspace
 * band does not exist at all — a plain member passes none of that band's
 * gates, so the library drops the band and every row in it.
 *
 * **The help control sits beside it** (`sidebar-help-menu.tsx`): "Guide me" and
 * "Report a problem", the two things a stuck user reaches for. "Guide me" used
 * to be a permanent row in the rail's lead run, the one entry pointing at no
 * screen and therefore the one that could never light. Asking for help is not a
 * destination, so it wears a help control at the foot of the navigation instead
 * of a slot among the destinations. What it runs is the shared
 * {@link useRunGuidedSetup}, the same composition the Academy's setup chapter
 * spends, so the guided setup can never start two different ways.
 *
 * Settings is the rail's LAST row. The avatar menu that used to close the rail
 * is gone: once Settings became a permanent row here, a second control opening
 * "Account settings" was a second door onto the same page. Identity moved INTO
 * that page, where the Settings index now opens on the signed-in person's face,
 * email and Sign out (`settings/identity-header.tsx`).
 *
 * The row is drawn with `SidebarNavItem` — the same component `SidebarNavList`
 * renders every other destination through — so it is a rail row rather than a
 * lookalike, and `collapsed` gives it the icon-rail anatomy for free. The help
 * control follows it in the same direction: beside the row while the rail is
 * expanded, stacked under the glyph while it is the icon strip.
