 * whole, so the rail still has ONE actions object. They live apart because they
 * are the only ones that patch a cache optimistically and must undo it, and
 * that shape is worth stating once for both rather than twice.
 *
 * Every mutation here already owns its error surface (`agent-team-write.ts`:
 * expected gateway states become an informational toast, anything else becomes

 * their own; the two optimistic ones add exactly one, for their own rollback.
