 * The rail's top-level nav sections and which row is lit.
 *
 * Every entry navigates AND closes the phone's More menu — the one rule both
 * callbacks below share, so they are paired here instead of being repeated at
 * the call site. The active id comes from the same place because it answers the
 * same question: only a TOP-LEVEL view lights a nav row, and a team screen
 * lights a team row instead (`useSidebarTeamsModel`).
 *
 * Every entry POINTS AT A SCREEN. "Guide me" points at none, so it is an item
 * behind the footer's help control (`sidebar-help-menu.tsx`) rather than a row
 * here, and arming the tour is not composed in this hook.
 *
 * The rail's FOOTER cluster is not here either: the Academy and Settings are
 * drawn by `sidebar-footer.tsx`, below the teams the rail lists.
