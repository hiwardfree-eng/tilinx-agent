/**
 * The four standing rules of the shell's frame, kept out of its layout. The
 * decisions behind rules 1 and 2 are pure functions in `view-guard-rules.ts`;
 * what lives here is the effect around them.
 *
 * 1. **Boot lands on the first team's Mission Control.** The store starts on
 *    the Agents home, the screen that needs no team, so the first paint is
 *    honest while the teams are still resolving. The moment the first team
 *    lands, home is its Mission Control and that is where the user goes.
 *    One shot per
 *    workspace, re-armed on a workspace change (each space boots into its own
 *    first team), and dropped the moment the user navigates somewhere of their
 *    own during the read.
 * 2. **The open view must exist.** Every screen is a top-level view now, so a
 *    `viewMode` no screen answers to, a view this caller's gates hide (the AI
 *    Models hub for a plain member, Admin for anyone but an owner/admin of a
 *    team space, the assistant where discovery hands out no address), or a team
 *    that stopped existing under an open team view all fall through every render
 *    branch and strand the user on a blank card. Each goes home. Two cases WAIT
 *    instead, because they are in-flight rather than stale: a dead TEAM view in
 *    a workspace with no teams, and a gated view whose capabilities have not
 *    resolved yet.
 * 3. **Something is always current.** `currentAgent` no longer picks a SCREEN,
 *    but provider routing, model prefs and the palette still read it, so the
 *    first agent adopts it when nothing has.
 * 4. **One `tab_opened` point.** Watching `viewMode` catches every path that
 *    changes it — rail click, shortcut, programmatic redirect — and fires on
 *    real transitions only, never on the first landing (`install_created`
 *    already records that).
