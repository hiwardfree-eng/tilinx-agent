 * The app frame: the rail, the ONE floating screen card, and the shared detail

 *
 * Every screen is a top-level view (`topLevelScreenViews`) — Mission Control, a
 * team, Integrations, Skills, the Store, Settings, the AI hub. Agents have no
 * screen of their own: an agent's work is a slice of its TEAM's sections, and
 * configuring one is the agent settings page reached through Team Settings.
 * `lib/agent-nav.ts` owns that translation, so the frame never has to know it,
 * and this file is layout plus the dialogs that float over it — the standing
 * view rules live in {@link useWorkspaceViewGuards}.
