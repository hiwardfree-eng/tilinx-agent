 * Everything a DRAG in the rail writes, on both backends.

 * another block is not a valid gesture any more (`@tilinx-ai/layout` refuses
 * it before it can commit), so the only thing a drag can say is "this agent
 * sits here inside its team" or "this team sits here in the list". Moving an
 * agent between teams is an explicit, named action on the team screen — a
 * question worth a deliberate answer, not something a slip of the wrist over a
 * rail full of blocks can decide.
 *
 * That leaves ONE optimistic write here, the team reorder: off-capability it is
 * a plain stored-layout write, and on a server host the server owns team order
 * (`sortOrder`) while the stored layout is only the per-user ORDERING OVERLAY.
 * The agent reorder is the overlay's on both backends and needs no optimism,
 * because nothing about it round-trips.
