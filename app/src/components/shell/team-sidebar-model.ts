/**
 * Whether a team's block is folded shut, for EVERY team the rail draws.
 *
 * One resolver rather than two readings of the same layout, because the answer
 * is needed twice and the two must agree: the block builder paints a collapsed
 * team's header as active (`teamRowActive`), and the highlight drops the agent
 * pin for exactly the same teams (`sidebarSelectedAgentId`) since their agent
 * rows are not drawn. Two copies would eventually light a header AND an agent
 * row in one folded block.
 *
 * The flag lives in two places because the default team is VIRTUAL: it owns no
 * stored group row, so its state is the layout's own additive
 * `defaultCollapsed` (absent reads as expanded), while a named team's is its
 * group's `collapsed`. A team with no stored row at all (a server team nobody
 * has folded yet) is expanded.
