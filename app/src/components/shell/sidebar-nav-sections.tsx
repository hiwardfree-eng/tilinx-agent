/**
 * The rail's top-level destinations, in three runs above "Your teams".
 *
 * 1. **Unlabelled** — the Assistant and the Agent Store. Who you ask for
 *    anything, and where agents come from: the things a user reaches for
 *    without being asked, so they lead the rail and need no heading over them.
 *    The Assistant leads the run because it is the one row that answers a
 *    question the user has not worked out how to ask yet; it is the only row
 *    gated on DISCOVERY rather than on a role, and it is absent where no
 *    assistant exists.
 * 2. **"My accounts"** — the connections that belong to the PERSON: the apps
 *    they have OAuthed and the AI accounts they run their turns on. Nobody
 *    else in the space is affected by either.
 * 3. **"Workspace"** — what the SPACE is made of, which makes the whole band
 *    owner territory rather than everyone's: Admin (`showOrganization`) and the
 *    shared Skills library (`showSkills`, the space owner's). An org admin
 *    therefore sees Admin; a plain member passes neither gate and sees no
 *    Workspace band at all.
 *
 * A section the gates empty is DROPPED by the library, band and all
 * (`SidebarNavList` filters on `items.length`), so a heading can never outlive
 * the rows it names — which is the ONE rule, and why nothing here needs a
 * second one asking whether a run came out empty.
 *
 * Five things a reader may come looking for live elsewhere, each on purpose.
 * Per-agent policy is every team's focused agent screen, discovered through
 * the team that owns the agent. Time worked is a section inside Admin, beside
 * the activity feed and usage bars it is read against. About me is a Settings
 * section: what the agents know about the person is a standing preference,
 * kept with their name and their language. "Guide me" is one of two items
 * behind the help control in the rail's footer (`sidebar-help-menu.tsx`),
 * because it points at no screen. The Academy and Settings are the rail's
 * FOOTER cluster (`sidebar-footer.tsx`): learning to fly and the person's own
 * chrome sit under the space's contents rather than above them, and both must
 * stay reachable in the deployments where the Workspace band does not exist.
