/**
 * The cached top-level screens, separated from the shell's agent-tab chrome.
 *
 * Admin is a screen of its own here, gated so it is never even mounted where it
 * would have nothing to show (`showOrganization`: multiplayer owner/admin, and
 * a TEAM active space on a Spaces host). The Academy is ungated: learning the
 * product exists in every deployment. Settings carries its own sections, About
 * me among them (`lib/settings-sections.ts`).
 *
 * Two screens that used to be here are gone. Permissions listed the space's
 * agents to reach one's settings page, which every team's "focused agent screen"
 * section already does per team, in every deployment. Time worked is a lens
 * inside Admin.
 *
 * Every team shares the ONE `team` screen for the same reason: it reads the
 * open team and section from the UI store, so the cache survives switching
 * between teams and no view id is ever orphaned by a deleted team.
