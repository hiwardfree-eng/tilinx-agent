/**
 * The square "create something" tile: one visual language for every modal that
 * asks "what am I making?". The sidebar's create chooser and step 1 of the
 * create-agent dialog both render a grid of these, so the second screen reads
 * as a continuation of the first rather than a different product.
 *
 * The fill is the SOLID chip pair, not `bg-input`: a modal's surface
 * (`bg-dialog`) and `bg-input` are the same neutral in dark mode, where an
 * input-filled tile disappears entirely. `chip-solid` / `chip-solid-hover` is
 * the one recessed step designed to stay visible on a solid surface in both
 * themes, and the hairline gives the edge its crisp line — dark mode carries
 * depth in hairlines, never shadows.
 *
 * On hover the tile wakes as ONE object: the fill steps up and the icon
 * sharpens from muted to ink together. Never the icon alone — a part of a
 * control changing without the whole reads as two controls.
 *
 * On a phone the square becomes a full-width row (icon, then label): three
 * squares do not fit a 343px dialog, and a stacked list of rows is what a
 * phone action sheet already looks like. At md+ the square is unchanged.
