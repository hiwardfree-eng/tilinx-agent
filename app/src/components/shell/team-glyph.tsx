/**
 * The mark a team wears, everywhere a team is drawn: its block header in the
 * rail, row 1 of its own screen, and the rows of the "Move to team" picker. ONE
 * component for all of them, so no two surfaces can disagree about what a team
 * looks like.
 *
 * **A team's glyph DOES pin a colour, and that bends `sidebar-anatomy.md`'s
 * third invariant on purpose.** That rule ("a row's glyph never pins a colour",
 * so an active row brightens as one object) still governs every other row in
 * the rail. A team is the exception because its colour is not decoration: it is
 * identity the user picked, the same thing an agent's helmet colour is, and it
 * is a product decision by Julian. It rides the AGENT mechanism rather than a
 * second palette — one vocabulary, one set of tokens — so a team and an agent
 * can never drift into two different meanings of "purple".
 *
 * The untouched case is unchanged: with no colour chosen no style is set at
 * all, the glyph inherits the row's own ink, and the header still brightens as
 * one object exactly as invariant 3 asks.
 *
 * An icon NAME this client does not know degrades to the neutral `Users` mark,
 * never to a hole: a server host may hold a glyph from a newer client's
 * vocabulary, and a team with no mark at all would read as a broken row.
