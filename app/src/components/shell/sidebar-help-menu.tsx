/**
 * The rail footer's "?": the two things a stuck user reaches for, behind one
 * control beside the Settings gear.
 *
 * "Guide me" used to be a permanent row in the rail's lead run, sitting among
 * destinations while pointing at no screen — the one entry that could never
 * light, and a standing slot spent on something a user needs once. Asking for
 * help is not a destination, so it wears a help control instead, where every
 * other product puts one: the foot of the navigation, next to settings.
 *
 * "Report a problem" joins it because it answers the same question from the
 * other end. It opens Settings on its Report bug section rather than duplicating
 * that surface: one bug-report screen, two doors, and the one that lives here is
 * the one a user finds while something is going wrong.
 *
 * The trigger wears the library's OWN affordance treatment
 * (`sidebarRowAffordanceClasses`), imported rather than restated — the same
 * class the band's "+" and every team's "..." wear, so the rail's small controls
 * cannot drift apart by being hand-copied. Always visible and muted,
 * strengthening on hover and focus: TilinX forbids hover-GATED affordances.
 *
 * Collapsed, it keeps the footer's idiom rather than the row's: the strip has no
 * room for a label, so the glyph is centred under the Settings icon and names
 * itself through a tooltip, exactly as `SidebarNavItem` does there.
