 *
 * Three things have to hold at once, which is why this is a small machine
 * rather than a condition:
 *
 * - **One shot per workspace.** Once boot has moved the user (or decided not
 *   to), it never fires again for that workspace.
 * - **Re-armed when the workspace changes.** Each space boots into its OWN
 *   first team. The view open on the tick the id changes belongs to the space
 *   the user just LEFT, so that tick only arms: reading it as "the user
 *   navigated" would disarm every space switch before its new landing was even
 *   set, and `create-team-dialog`'s `openHome()` (which lands on the Agents
 *   home while the new space's teams are still in flight) would strand the
 *   user there.
 * - **The user always wins.** A view other than the Agents home, on any tick
 *   after the arming one, means the user moved during the teams read. Boot
 *   disarms rather than yanking them out of what they opened.
 *
 * With no team resolved yet the Agents home simply stands and the guard stays
 * armed, so the first team to land is what moves the user on.

 * Models hub for a plain member, Admin outside a team space or below
 * owner/admin, the assistant on a deployment that serves none), or a team that
 * stopped existing under an open team view all fall through every render branch
 * and strand the user on a blank card. Those go home.
 *
 * A GATED view whose gates have not resolved yet WAITS. The gates are computed
 * from `capabilities` and from assistant discovery, both null until their
 * fetches land, so every one of them reads false in that window: acting on it would bounce a user off the very
 * screen they persisted, on every boot and every space switch — and a team-space
 * switch drops the capabilities query outright, so the window is deterministic
 * rather than theoretical.
 *
 * The other exception is a dead TEAM view in a workspace with NO teams at all:
 * the server-backed teams read answers `[]` on its first pass, so "the team you
 * are on does not exist" is indistinguishable from "the teams have not arrived
 * yet" — and bouncing there throws the user off the very team about to land.
 * The guard waits it out; the team either resolves (nothing happened) or the
 * list arrives without it (this rule then sends them home). A `viewMode` that
 * is not a top-level view at all carries no such ambiguity: no teams read can
 * ever make it valid, so it goes home even with no teams, and home with no
 * teams is the Agents home.
