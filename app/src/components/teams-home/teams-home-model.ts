/**
 * The phone's Teams tree, as data: every team with its section rows indented
 * under it.
 *
 * The rows are the DESKTOP's own: the team strip's sections, in the strip's
 * order, with the same words — Tasks, Routines, Files, Team Settings. The
 * Team Settings row is the door the desktop has (Context, Agents, People and
 * Settings live BEHIND it, as tabs of the drilled level), so a phone user
 * finds each thing exactly where the desktop keeps it rather than a flattened
 * copy of the two levels.
 *
 * The list is re-asked here rather than trusted from anywhere: it is the same
 * gate the team view itself re-runs on every render, so the tree can never
 * offer a section the view would refuse.
 *
 * Pure, and unit-tested in `app/tests/teams-home-model.test.ts`.
