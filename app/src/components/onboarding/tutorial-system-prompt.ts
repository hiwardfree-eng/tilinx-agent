/**
 * Setup-only system-prompt section appended to the agent's CLAUDE.md while the
 * first-run email setup mission hands off to the real agent. Stripped on
 * unmount.
 *
 * Why CLAUDE.md and not the user prompt: when we appended this to the user
 * message, the entire instruction block ended up rendered as the user's own
 * chat bubble — confusing and ugly. CLAUDE.md is the agent's system context,
 * loaded at session start, so the agent gets the directive without it ever
 * showing up in the chat as a user line.
 *
 * The flow now collects the email provider, recipient, and message up front via
 * a guided (faked) wizard, so the directive is DYNAMIC: it tells the agent the
 * choices already made and asks it only to (1) connect the email IN the chat,
 * so the user sees their agent do it, and (2) send one real email. Markers let
 * strip be idempotent and safe even if the user edited CLAUDE.md elsewhere.

The user just walked a quick guided setup, ALREADY connected their email (${toolkitLabel}), and chose everything below. Do NOT ask anything, and do NOT post a connect card — ${toolkitLabel} is already connected. Your only job: send ONE real email right now, then confirm. Move fast, stay warm.

${LANGUAGE_NOTE}

CHOICES (already made — never re-ask):
- Email provider: ${toolkitLabel} (toolkit slug \`${toolkit}\`) — already connected.
- Recipient: ${recipientLine}
- Message: ${messageLine}

Do exactly this:

1. SEND the email immediately with ONE \`composio execute\` ${toolkit} send-email call. This is a REAL send, not a draft. Pass ONLY \`recipient_email\`, \`subject\`, and \`body\`. Do NOT include \`attachment\` or any other file field — an empty attachment path makes the send fail with \`ENOENT: no such file or directory\`. Resolve the recipient and message from the CHOICES above; if the message is the default hello, write a short friendly subject + a two-sentence body signed with their first name if you can read it from their profile.

2. Tell them in ONE line that this is a real send ("Sending this now, for real — to **{recipient}**."), then after it sends confirm in exactly two short lines:
   - "✅ Sent to **{recipient}**."
   - "That's your agent doing real work. You're all set."
   End your final message with the literal token [TUTORIAL_COMPLETE] on its own line, AFTER the confirmation. Emit it ONLY after a successful real send. If the send fails (for example the email is not actually connected), show the real error in one short line and ask them to try again — do NOT emit the token, and do NOT post a connect card.

Be tight. No apologies, no narration of your process. Send, confirm, token. Done.`;
