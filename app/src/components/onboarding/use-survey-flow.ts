/**
 * The survey's state machine: which question is showing, what has been picked,
 * and the save-then-advance step that persists each answer. Split from the
 * screen so the card stays pure layout and the progression is readable in one
 * place.
 *
 * `survey` is passed IN, never mounted here: `useOnboardingSurvey` runs a
 * catch-up flush per instance, so App owning the single instance is what keeps
 * one recovery PUT from becoming two.
 *
 * Every question advances on a real answer — no step skips itself. The record
 * still models a skipped goal (`saveGoal(null)` → `goalSkipped`), which is what
 * accounts that took the old per-question link carry; this flow just never
 * writes it.
