 * `onboarding_pending` brings a quit-mid-setup user back INTO the flow, but
 * the flow used to restart at its welcome beat every time. On a phone that is
 * not a rare path: leaving the tab to fetch a sign-in code (claude.ai, an
 * authenticator) is enough for the browser to evict and reload the page, and
 * the user came back to "Start setup" with the paste dialog gone. The current
 * step is mirrored on the device and the run re-enters at the last SAFE beat
 * of the sequence it was in — a spot step re-armed by its own intro or
 * sidebar beat, never a step whose in-memory prerequisites (the agent-count
 * baseline, the send discipline, an open dialog) the reload dropped.
