 * question → answers → Continue) on TilinX's white setup card, the
 * presentation the segmentation screen shipped with.
 *
 * Mounted twice over a user's life: as the first-run intro ahead of the
 * create-your-assistant flow, and as an in-app prompt that fills the gaps for
 * anyone who only ever answered the job question.
 *
 * The card is a fixed frame (`SetupCard`), so the column SCROLLS when it is
 * taller than the frame — a short phone viewport under browser chrome. It is
 * centered by auto margins rather than `justify-center`, which would keep
 * centering an overflowing column and push the logo above the card's top
 * edge and Continue below its bottom, out of reach. Keyed by step so each
 * question opens at its top: Continue sits at the bottom of the scroll, and
 * the next question would otherwise inherit that position, headline hidden.
