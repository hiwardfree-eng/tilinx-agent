  return `Put together my morning briefing for today. Keep it short and skimmable — I read this before I start my day.

Write the whole briefing in ${languageName}. That is the language I read, so every heading and every line goes in ${languageName}, not English.

Before you write anything, check what you can actually reach right now:
- Is a calendar connected (Google Calendar / Outlook Calendar)?
- Is an inbox connected (Gmail / Outlook)?

Build the briefing only from what IS connected. Never lead with what is missing, and never turn this into an apology for something you could not do.

1. If a calendar is connected, read today's events. List each meeting with its time, title, and who is attending. Flag anything back-to-back or without a clear agenda.
2. If an inbox is connected, scan for unread or recent messages from the last day. Pull out only what actually needs me: direct questions, things waiting on my reply, deadlines, and anything time-sensitive. Skip newsletters, receipts, and automated noise.
3. Write the briefing as a couple of short sections with natural headings in ${languageName} — for example a "today's schedule" section (a tight list of meetings) and a "needs your attention" section (a few bullets, most important first). Those English names are only illustrations; use real ${languageName} headings. If an email ties to a meeting today, say so.
4. If exactly one of the two is connected, build the briefing from that one, then add at most ONE short, low-key line inviting me to connect the other (for example, in ${languageName}, "Connect your calendar and I can fold your schedule in here too"). One line, at the end, never at the top, never a complaint.
5. If NEITHER a calendar NOR an inbox is connected, there is nothing to brief and no way to build one. Do not write a briefing and do not apologize — end your response with exactly "ROUTINE_OK" on its own line so this run stays silent.

Do not send anything or change anything in my connected apps. This is a read-only summary for me.`;

# Meeting Prep

## When to use

- Explicit: "prep me for my next meeting", "what do I need to know before this call", "brief me before my 3pm", "who am I meeting with next".
- Implicit: proactively, shortly before a calendar event that has attendees you do not recognize or a company you have not met before.
- Read-only research. I never reply to anyone or change the invite; I just gather context and hand it to you.

## Steps

1. **Find the next meeting.** Look at the connected calendar (Google Calendar / Outlook Calendar) and pick the next upcoming event with other attendees. If the user named a specific meeting, use that one instead. If nothing is coming up, say so and stop.
2. **Identify the attendees.** Read the invite for the attendee list, their email addresses, and the domains (which tell you the company). Note the organizer separately. If it is an internal-only meeting, say so — the prep is lighter.
3. **Search the inbox for context.** Query Gmail / Outlook for recent threads with those people and with their company domain. Pull out what you last discussed, any open questions, commitments either side made, and anything still waiting on a reply. Quote the most recent relevant message so the user can place it.
4. **Do a light web check.** If there is a real person or company name to search, run a quick web lookup for recent, relevant public context (what the company does, recent news, the person's role). Be honest about the limits: TilinX has no CRM or sales-intelligence tool, so this is research from what is already in the inbox plus a quick public web check — not enriched contact data.
5. **Write a short brief and hand it over before the meeting.** Structure: who is on the call (name, role, company), what you last discussed with them, and anything time-sensitive to raise or watch for. Write the brief in ${languageName} — that is the language the user reads. Keep it to a few lines the user can read in under a minute. Deliver it before the meeting starts, not after. Do not send anything to the attendees.

## Never invent

Every claim ties to something you actually found — an email thread, the invite, or a web result. If the inbox search returned nothing and there is no public info, say "no prior context found" rather than guessing. If a tool errored, say so and hand over what you have.`;
