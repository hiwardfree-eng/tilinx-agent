/**
 * The in-app onboarding's step machine, pure so it unit-tests without React
 * (`app/tests/in-app-onboarding-flow.test.ts`). The component observes the
 * app's live signals and asks this function what the tutorial should do —
 * spot steps advance on the app's own state; center cards and the
 * already-done addenda advance by their own button.
 *
 * EVERY user walks EVERY step and every step keeps its full teaching — the
 * tutorial shows WHERE things live, so nothing is skipped for being already
 * done. A goal already met when the user ARRIVES at its step gets an in-place
 * addendum with a skip button (never a replaced step); only a goal met DURING
 * the step celebrates.
