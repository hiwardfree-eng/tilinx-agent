/**
 * A lesson's DO-IT beat: the app dims, the real control stays lit, and ONE
 * sentence whispers beside it.
 *
 * There is no coach card. What the whisper carries is only what has to be read
 * here and now — the sentence, the count, and the way out — on a quiet popover
 * surface beside the control. No buttons that move the lesson on: the interface
 * itself is the next click.
 *
 * The copy area stays click-through, so the control it points at is reachable
 * even where the two overlap; the close is the one thing on it that takes a
 * click.
 *
 * A beat that is not `armed` yet ({@link import("./lesson-arming").lessonBeatArmed})
 * shows the same whisper over an UNBROKEN veil: no hole, no cues, and the
 * blockers covering the viewport, exactly as they do while the target is off
 * screen. The taught click is therefore impossible until the beat can see it,
 * which is the difference between a lesson that waits a moment and a lesson
 * that strands the user on a step they already did.
 *
 * The veil is the same one the guided setup wears (composed, not restyled — the
 * mandatory setup must stay exactly as it is); this file is only the whisper
 * and the placement it needs.
