 * building that art before there is more than one real chapter would be
 * decoration standing in for content. What ships is honest: the one chapter
 * that exists, its true state read from the stored record, and the stops after
 * it drawn as locked so the shape of the climb is visible without pretending
 * those chapters are ready.
 *
 * The record is skeletoned rather than assumed while it loads: an unread record
 * looks exactly like an untouched one, so drawing it would offer "Start" to
 * someone who finished the chapter months ago and then swap the button under
 * their cursor.
