/**
 * One stop on the Academy path: a marker, what the chapter is, and the one
 * thing to do about it.
 *
 * Props-only and state-driven rather than three near-copies of a row, so the
 * marker, the tone and the affordance can never disagree about the same
 * chapter. A locked node carries no button at all — a disabled control invites
 * a click that answers nothing.
 *
 * Rows are transparent planes joined by a hairline rail, not a grid of bordered
 * cards: a path reads as one line the eye can follow. A row you can act on
 * paints the app's own row fill under the pointer, exactly as the flat page
 * language does everywhere else; a LOCKED row stays flat and quiet, because
 * painting a row that answers nothing is a promise the path cannot keep. The
 * focus ring belongs to the button inside the row and to nothing else — a
 * second ring around the whole row would draw two rectangles for one target.
