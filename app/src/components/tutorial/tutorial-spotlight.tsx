/**
 * A tutorial's interactive spotlight: dims the shell behind the lesson's
 * blackish scrim but leaves a HOLE over the target that clicks
 * pass straight through — the user performs the real action on the real
 * control (game-tutorial style), instead of reading about it on a card.
 *
 * Anatomy: four transparent blocker panels around the hole own the pointer
 * events (a box-shadow is not hit-testable, so the visual scrim alone blocks
 * nothing); the tour's cutout div (rounded ring + giant veil shadow) paints the
 * dark veil without intercepting anything; a compact coach card sits beside
 * the hole and tells the user what to click and why. While the target is not
 * on screen yet (the view is still switching), the veil covers everything and
 * the card centers — the measurer keeps polling, so the hole opens the moment
 * the anchor renders.
 *
 * All the measuring and placement math lives in
 * {@link import("./tutorial-spotlight-geometry")} and everything painted around
 * the hole in {@link import("./tutorial-spotlight-veil")}; this file is the
 * coach card.
