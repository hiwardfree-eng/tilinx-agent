/**
 * About me: what every agent knows about the PERSON before it starts a turn.
 *
 * A Settings section, because it is a standing preference the user sets once
 * about themselves — the same drawer their name, their photo and their
 * language live in. It drills in from the Settings index and wears that
 * screen's chrome (the back bar and the reading column), so it draws the
 * editor as a COMPACT card ({@link ContextEditorBox}'s `rows` mode) rather
 * than the pinned full-window page a top-level surface gets: the column
 * scrolls, and a card that claimed the viewport height inside it would have
 * none to claim.
 *
 * The stored file is the workspace context blob's `user` slot
 * (`context-slots.ts` → `use-workspace-context.ts`), which the open agent's
 * runtime reads into its prompt. `ready` gates the box behind a spinner while
 * that read lands: a loading frame, not an empty state.
