/**
 * The signin-step content for a queued sign-in inside the shared
 * `ChatInteractionCard` sequence (its `renderSignin` prop). A tool call hit
 * `signin_required` (the desktop host has an integration registry but the user
 * is signed out), so the host queued this step; the Sign in button drives the
 * SAME Google SSO the Integrations page uses (via {@link useIntegrationsGate}),
 * and the sequence advances the instant the gate reports `ready`.
 *
 * Following the reference "Coworker card" language, it renders as its OWN
 * `InteractionModal` (wired with the `StepChrome` the stepper hands it): the
 * TITLE is the identity lockup — the TilinX helmet beside the "TilinX" name at
 * regular weight — over a two-field body: the agent's REASON (or "Sign in to
 * TilinX") in foreground tone, then the muted explainer line. A right-aligned
 * footer carries the unified quiet "Not now" + Esc hint beside the single filled
 * "Sign in" pill (with a return-key glyph). Enter signs in, Esc declines, both
 * ignored while focus sits in a text field.
 *
 * The header pager owns Back/Forward, so a REVISITED step needs no navigation
 * button of its own: already signed in -> no footer; skipped -> the Sign in CTA
 * (and its paired "Not now") return so the user can reconsider. "Not now"
 * travels WITH the Sign in CTA so the decline affordance is present wherever
 * signing in is offered.
 *
 * Auto-advance also covers the STALE step: the user may have signed in elsewhere
 * (the Integrations page) between the turn ending and this card rendering, so the
 * gate is ALREADY `ready` on first render with no button to click — fire
 * `onSignedIn` once so the queued connects/answers still send.
