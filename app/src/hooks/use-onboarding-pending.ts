 * durable flag closes that gap: arming the in-app setup on a first-run boot
 * sets it (`ArmInAppOnboarding`) and every finish clears it, and App.tsx routes
 * into onboarding while it's set. Absent flag (every existing, fully-onboarded
 * user) reads as not-pending, so their behavior is unchanged.
 *
 * Re-entry is safe by construction: the flow re-enters at its welcome beat and
 * every step is a spotlight over the real control, so an already-connected
 * provider, an existing agent and a connected toolkit each render their
 * already-done addendum instead of asking for the work twice.
