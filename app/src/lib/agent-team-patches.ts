 * honour. The overlay is left alone — it only orders agents INSIDE a team, and
 * an id it no longer holds decays out of it on the next write (rule 7).

 * changes nothing (or names a team the cache does not hold), so there is
 * nothing to send.
 *
 * The value is the MIDPOINT of the two teams it lands between, `first - 1` at
 * the top and `last + 1` at the bottom. One team moves, so one `PATCH` goes
 * out: renumbering the whole list would fire a request per team and stop
 * halfway at the first team the caller does not own, leaving the space's order
 * half-applied for everybody. C13 takes a plain number, and the gateway sorts
 * by `(sortOrder, createdAt, id)`.
 *
 * `teams` is the WHOLE cached list, the default team included: the rail draws
 * that one as its own trailing block and never lets it be dragged, but the
 * gateway orders it with the rest, so it is a real neighbour. The one position
 * this cannot express is between two teams that already share a `sortOrder` —
 * there is no number between them — and the gateway then keeps its own
 * `(createdAt, id)` tie-break. Neither the gateway nor the fake host mints
 * duplicates, so that is a corrupted-data state, not a flow.
