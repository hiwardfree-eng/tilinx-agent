 * editor.
 *
 * New chats carry `SKILL_SETUP_AGENT_MODE`; board surfaces hide it via
 * `isSetupChatMode` (`integration-chat-setup.ts`), the shared predicate for
 * every guided-setup sentinel. The kickoff prompts live in
 * `skill-chat-prompts.ts`. This module owns the sentinel and the chat <->
 * skill link resolution.
 *
 * The chat <-> skill link is stored in both directions, the same shape as
 * routines: the skill's frontmatter `setup_activity_id` (written by the agent
 * when it creates the skill) and the activity's `skill_slug` (client-stamped,
 * durable because agents never rewrite activity.json). The frontmatter side
 * is fragile — the agent rewrites SKILL.md whenever it edits the skill — so
 * resolution trusts the reverse link first and a heal restores the missing
 * activity stamp.
