 * Which TilinX deployment this CLIENT belongs to — the same vocabulary the

 * activation.ts` EngineDeployment), so ONE Sentry filter spans a deployment's
 * whole stack: `deployment:managed-cloud` returns the cloud pods' errors AND
 * the errors users hit in an app talking to those pods.
 *
 * Without this, cloud-side client failures (a 502 from the gateway, an agent
 * that never woke) were only findable by knowing the internal name of the
 * function that throws them — the surface a user actually experiences was the
 * hardest half of the cloud product to query.
 *
 * `dev` is deliberately NOT a value: the client already reports its dev-ness in
 * the `environment` tag, and a developer pointing at a hosted gateway is still
 * exercising the managed-cloud topology.

 * Resolve the client's deployment. Pure — the caller supplies the resolved

 *
 * - `override` is `window.__TILINX_DEPLOYMENT__`, published by the web build
 *   before the app graph loads (`packages/web/src/main.tsx`): one web bundle
 *   serves both the cloud site and a self-host Connect screen, so only it can
 *   know which one this tab is. An unrecognized value is ignored rather than
 *   trusted — the tag must never carry arbitrary strings.
 * - a hosted gateway (desktop cloud build) is `managed-cloud`.
 * - an explicit host URL is `selfhost`, unless it is loopback — that is the
 *   dev two-terminal setup against a co-located host, i.e. `desktop`.
 * - no flags at all is the Tauri-spawned sidecar: `desktop`.
