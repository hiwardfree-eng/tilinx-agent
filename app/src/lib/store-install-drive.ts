/**
 * Pure decision core for the store-install deep link, factored out of
 * `useStoreInstallDeepLink` so it can be exhaustively tested without a React
 * renderer.
 *
 * A store-install deep link seeds the import wizard exactly once per intent.
 * The hazard is a SECOND delivery of the same slug: the website "Open in
 * TilinX" button is never disabled (a double-click fires the
 * `tilinx://store/install` deep link twice), and on cold start the shell both
 * stashes AND emits the URL, so the drain and the live event can both surface
 * it. Without dedup that second delivery re-arms the pending slug and re-fires
 * a full drive (double import + double install ping) the moment the wizard
 * closes.
 *
 * This reducer runs once per processing tick. It owns the small amount of
 * session state that survives across ticks (the refs) so the hook stays a thin
 * shell that only performs side effects the reducer names.
