 * A community skill install that failed because the skill no longer exists
 * where skills.sh says it does: the author removed or renamed it
 * (`skill_not_in_repo`, proven by the host's full repo scan) or deleted the
 * repo (`repo_not_found`, GitHub's 404). skills.sh keeps indexing both for
 * months, so users hit these on cards they did nothing wrong with; the install
 * handler shows the expected-state copy and drops the card, so the engine-call
 * layer logs it and stops there: no red toast, no Sentry issue (PRODUCT-1729,
 * TILINX-APP-5D7 / 5CS). Rate limits, offline, and untyped failures stay loud.
 *
 * Dependency-free (the typed `kind` is read here, not via `@tilinx-ai/skills`,
 * whose root barrel the app's node:test runner cannot load) so it is testable
 * directly (app/tests/skill-install-expected-state.test.ts).
