/**
 * The top-level views: EVERY full-window surface in the app, each reached from
 * the sidebar. `workspace-shell.tsx` renders one of them and nothing else — a
 * `viewMode` outside this set is stale and resets to the first team's Mission
 * Control (`use-workspace-view-guards.ts`); `sidebar.tsx` highlights the
 * matching nav item. Both predicates source from this one set so a new
 * top-level view (like the AI hub) can't be added to one and forgotten in the
 * other.
 *
 * There is no GLOBAL mission board any more. Every board belongs to a team, so
 * the app's home is the FIRST team's Mission Control and the screen that needs
 * no team is the Agents home — which is why it is where boot waits and where
 * every fallback lands while no team has resolved.
 *
 * The personal assistant is here too, leading the rail: it is a 1-on-1 chat
 * with an agent that can do anything the user can do in TilinX, so it owns the
 * whole window like every other destination rather than borrowing a board's
 * detail panel. It is the one view gated on DISCOVERY rather than on a role —
 * a deployment that holds no assistant has neither the row nor the screen.
 *
 * Admin is here, in the rail's "Workspace" band, and the Academy is here at the
 * foot of the rail: neither is a preference, so neither is a Settings section.
 * Each owns the whole window, and a read one of them owns is active while ITS
 * OWN screen is — not while `settings` is. Settings itself is general
 * preferences (About me among them), plus Danger
 * (`lib/settings-sections.ts`).
 *
 * There is no top-level Permissions view any more. It listed the space's agents
 * so an admin could open one's settings page, which is exactly what every
 * team's focused agent screen already does, per team, in every deployment:
 * agent policy is DISCOVERED through the team that owns the agent. Time worked
 * is gone from here too — it is a lens inside Admin > Analytics now, beside the
 * activity feed and the usage bars it was always read against.
 *
 * The team view is ONE id (`team`) rather than one per team: which team and
 * which of its sections are open is store state (`activeTeamId` /
 * `teamSection`), so every team shares one kept-alive screen and a team the
 * user deletes cannot leave a dead view id behind.
