 * `isLoading` (= `isPending && isFetching`). On a device with no network the
 * default `networkMode: "online"` PAUSES the query: pending, not fetching, not
 * errored — so `isLoading` reads false while nothing has been asked and nothing
 * has answered. Trusting it rendered the rail row and opened a pane with no
 * handle, no spinner and no error: a blank screen.
 *
 * Absence is a verdict on a SETTLED query. An errored query that is being
 * refetched (window focus, reconnect) still reads `status: "error"` until it
 * resolves, and calling that unavailable while the gates went ready is what
 * bounced a user out of the assistant screen mid-repair. A held address also
 * survives a failed revalidation: the address does not change under us, so a
 * refetch that fails is not a deployment that lost its assistant.
