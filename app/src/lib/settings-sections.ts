 * The settings sections that open on their own screen (a back bar returns to the

 * types its deep-link pin against it) and the deep-link parser stay node-testable
 * without pulling in React/lucide — and so the store never has to depend on a
 * component module.
 *
 * Every id below is the user's own app: their profile, what their agents know
 * about them, their keys, their shortcuts, a bug report, their migration. None
 * of them is gated and all of them read the current workspace, so there is no
 * per-section gate here and no opt-out from the Settings workspace gate — Admin
 * and Permissions, the two surfaces that needed both, are TOP-LEVEL views again
 * in the rail's "Workspace" band (`lib/top-level-views.ts`).
