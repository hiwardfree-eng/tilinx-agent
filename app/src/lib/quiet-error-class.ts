// The two "quiet" failure classes of the error-surfacing layer, and the
// context a low-noise Sentry event for one of them carries. Dependency-free
// (only the two classifiers) so it is node-testable directly
// (app/tests/quiet-error-class.test.ts).
//
// A quiet class is an expected environment state — the agent's pod waking
// (`isEngineWakingError`) or the device offline (`isNetworkTransportError`) —
// that the user sees as ONE informational toast, never the bug pair. Until
// PRODUCT-1640 the same classes were declined by every Sentry path outright,
// so a raw gateway body (a DNS dial error against a cold pod, say) existed
// only in the user's local frontend log: hidden from the user had become
// hidden from us. They now capture as a warning with a FIXED fingerprint per
// class (`quiet-error-report.ts`), so each class is one Sentry issue with a
// count and searchable bodies, and a deploy roll can never file new issues.

// Dependency-free subpath: the app's node:test entry points cannot load the
// SDK root (it pulls @tilinx/domain, whose extensionless imports node rejects).
