 *
 * That is why the rule is worth having at all: two surfaces read it to decide
 * whether to CLAIM a narrowing — the rail fills an agent row, and the team's
 * lozenge grows its second segment. Anywhere the pin does not narrow what is on
 * screen, both would assert something nothing is doing, and clicking the lit
 * row again would look like a no-op.
