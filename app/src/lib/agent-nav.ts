/**
 * Where an agent-scoped destination LIVES, now that agents have no tab shell.
 *
 * Every agent surface used to be a tab on the agent itself (Activity, Context,
 * Skills, Integrations, Routines, Files, Admin). They are gone: an agent's work
 * is a slice of its TEAM's sections, and configuring an agent is the canonical
 * agent settings page reached through Team Settings. This module is the ONE
 * translation from "take me to agent X's <thing>" into the team view the store
 * actually opens, so a notification, a @mention row, the command palette and a
 * turn summary can never land three different places.
 *
 * Pure and store-free (the caller passes the resolved teams in) so the rules are
 * unit-tested — `app/tests/agent-nav.test.ts`. The imperative side, which reads
 * the stores and dispatches, is `lib/open-agent.ts`.
