 * The expected-state taxonomy for the C13 agent-teams writes, following the

 * the classification and the copy map unit-test under bare Node.
 *
 * Every agent-teams MUTATION passes `{ silence: isExpectedAgentTeamError }` and
 * carries an `onError` that shows {@link agentTeamErrorCopy}'s strings in a
 * plain informational toast. That gives EXACTLY ONE surface either way:
 * expected -> the informational toast, unexpected -> `call()`'s red
 * "report a bug" toast. Never add a branch for these to `surfaceError` in
 * `tauri.ts`: `personal_space` already means something else there (the invite
 * flow), and the error alone cannot tell the two apart.
 */

/**
 * The C13 rejections that are EXPECTED business states, not TilinX bugs: the
 * default team refusing a rename-adjacent write, a personal space refusing to
 * manage PEOPLE (it groups agents into teams like any other space; only join
 * and the two member writes refuse there), a non-owner attempting an owner-only
 * write, a stale team id, a name the gateway will not take, and removing
 * someone who is not an explicit member. The code set is unchanged by that
 * narrowing — `personal_space` is still one answer the gateway can give, just
 * from three routes instead of every mutation.
 *
 * Everything else the gateway can answer (`team_not_found`,
 * `invalid_sort_order`, `invalid_owner`) means the client sent something it
 * should never have sent, so it must reach us as a bug report.
 *
 * `invalid_name` is here as belt and braces, and it is the only entry the USER
 * can provoke by typing. Every name-bearing input already stops at the
 * gateway's ceiling of 1..60 runes (`TEAM_NAME_MAX_RUNES`), so this should be
 * unreachable; if a name ever does get past them, a calm sentence about how
 * long a name may be is a truer answer than "report a bug".
 *
 * `invalid_icon` and `invalid_color` are the same bet, and the same honesty is
 * owed about it: they too should be unreachable. The gateway validates SHAPE
 * only (`^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$` for a glyph name, `#rrggbb` or a token name for a
 * color) because the VOCABULARY is the client's, and the picker only ever sends
 * a name from the client's own curated glyph set and a color from the shared
 * palette. So one of these arriving means the two drifted apart, which is our
 * bug — but the user is mid-gesture in a picker and nothing was changed, so a
 * calm sentence pointing back at the list beats a report-a-bug toast for a
 * choice they made from a list we drew.
