 * of the team `activeTeamId` names, the SAME call the team view makes for the
 * same team. That is the whole invariant: the rail and the view read one list
 * per team, so a row can never be lit for a section the screen refuses, and the
 * screen can never render a section with no row. Another team's list would
 * answer about the wrong door (Team Settings is per team).
 *
 * The section runs through `resolveTeamSection` rather than the raw store value,
 * so the rail follows the view's own fallback (a section with no surface yet, or
 * Team Settings pinned before a space switch demoted the caller) instead of
 * going blank under a board that is plainly on screen.
 *
 * An EMPTY `sections` means the active team no longer resolves; nothing is lit,
 * which is honest for the single frame before `blockedTeamView` sends the user
 * to the dashboard, and it keeps `resolveTeamSection` from being asked to pick
 * from nothing.

 * the more precise answer and the header steps aside. Two fills in one block
 * claim the user is in two places at once, which is worse than one that is
 * merely coarse.
 *
 * So the header lights whenever the open view belongs to this team AND no agent
 * row inside it is lit. That covers the folded block (its agent rows are not
 * drawn), a pin naming an agent this team no longer holds, and the plain
 * unfiltered board,
 * every case where nothing narrower is on screen to speak for the block.
 *
 * `section === null` is false: `resolveTeamHighlight` returns it off a team
 * view and when the active team no longer resolves, and lighting a block over
 * a dashboard would name a screen that is not there.

 *
 * - the open section has to honor the pin, unless agent focus is active;
 * - the agent has to still be a member of the open team. Drag it into another
 *   team and every section drops the filter and shows everything
 *   (`teamPinnedAgent` / `teamFilterPath` / `resolveFilterPath`); a row left lit
 *   in its new block would point at a filter nothing is applying.
 *
 * Off a team view, nothing: every other `viewMode` is a top-level view no agent
 * row belongs to.
 *
 * A COLLAPSED open team fills no agent row either, for the plainest reason
 * there is: the row is not rendered. Returning the pinned id would ask the rail
 * to light a row that does not exist — and the header takes the fill instead,
 * which is exactly what `teamRowActive` does with this answer.
 *
 * This is the FIRST half of the rail's one-fill rule: whatever it says, the
 * header says the opposite. It is asked first, and `teamRowActive` is handed
 * the result, so the two can never both light.
