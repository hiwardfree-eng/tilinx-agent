/**
 * Boot-time theme mirror — applies the user's theme on the FIRST paint.
 *
 * The engine preference `theme` is the source of truth, but it reads through
 * `tauriPreferences -> getEngine()`, which only answers after the engine
 * handshake. The boot splash renders DURING that handshake and is themed
 * (`bg-background`), so without a device-local mirror a dark-mode user stares
 * at the light surface for the whole handshake (seconds on a cold start) and
 * then snaps to dark.
 *
 * So the resolved theme is mirrored to localStorage every time it is applied,
 * and re-applied synchronously before React mounts. Same contract as the locale
 * flash-cache in `./i18n`: a cache to avoid a flash, never the source of truth
 * — the engine value still lands moments later and wins.
 *
 * DOM + localStorage only (no Tauri, no engine imports), so it is safe to
 * evaluate before the app module graph boots and stays unit-testable.

 * URL bar, PWA title bar) at the same surface the theme paints behind the app
 * (the body background in globals.css): light `input` #fcfcfc, dark `base`
