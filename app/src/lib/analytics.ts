   * 1. `alias(userId)` — adds the Firebase UID as an alias of the current
   *    install_id person. The distinct_id STAYS install_id (so the website
   *    `/welcome` UTM bridge and the sequential onboarding funnel are untouched),
   *    but because every device/reinstall aliases the SAME Firebase UID, PostHog
   *    stitches a human's separate per-device persons into ONE. alias is the call
   *    that merges; a second `identify()` with a new distinct_id is ignored once
   *    a person is identified, so identify is NOT a substitute here.
   * 2. `setPersonProperties` — also stamps `firebase_uid` (plus email `$set`,
   *    signup_date `$set_once`) so the id is a queryable join key to the identity
   *    platform, not only an internal alias. Email is a person property for
   *    lookup/filtering, never an event prop.
   *
   * Finally flips `auth_status` → "authenticated" and stamps `auth_platform`:
   * "gcp" as super properties so every event going forward is tagged with the
   * signed-in platform. Identity-platform discontinuity is ACCEPTED: the UID is
   * a fresh Firebase UID (not the old Supabase id), so historical Supabase-id
   * joins do not carry over — this is a fresh platform, by design.
