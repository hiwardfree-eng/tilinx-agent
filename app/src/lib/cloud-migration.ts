/**
 * Pure logic for the first-run desktop→cloud migration wizard (HOU-719).
 *
 * The cloud-only desktop build finds the OLD local install's data
 * (`~/.tilinx`, written by the legacy desktop app) and offers to move every
 * legacy agent into the user's cloud account. This module owns the plan
 * (target names, collision renames, resume), the chunking of an agent's
 * manifest into upload-sized batches, and the per-agent progress state types.
 * I/O lives in `cloud-migration-transport.ts` / `stores/cloud-migration.ts`.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free so `node --test` can exercise it directly
 * (see `app/tests/cloud-migration.test.ts`).
