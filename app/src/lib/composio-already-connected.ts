 * -> `CoreError::Labeled` in
 * `engine/tilinx-engine-server/src/routes/composio.rs`).
 *
 * This is an expected, explainable state, NOT a TilinX bug: it means the
 * caller's cached connected-toolkits list was stale, which is why the
 * Connect button was still live. Surfaces refresh that list so the card
 * flips to its connected state, and the engine-call wrapper silences the
 * error (no red bug toast, no Sentry report). See HOU-463.
