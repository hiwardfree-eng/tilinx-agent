 * The pod-bound tail of agent creation, run after the dialog has already
 * revealed the agent (HOU-649): persist the picked provider/model and, if the
 * user accepted one, its starter routine. Both dispatch to the agent's engine,
 * so on the hosted profile they wait out the pod's cold start — off the create
 * click. Each step surfaces its own error toast via the tauri wrappers; we only
 * add a breadcrumb so a background failure is traceable.
 *
 * Shared by the create-agent dialog and the import wizard (HOU-710) — both
 * must reveal first and finish setup in the background.
