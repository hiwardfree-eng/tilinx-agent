 *
 * On the hosted profile, creating an agent answers immediately while its
 * engine warms up in the background (HOU-649) — the warm-up can take a couple
 * of minutes, and the platform gives the client no readiness field or event.
 * What it DOES guarantee: any per-agent request is held until the engine is
 * reachable and then answered, so a cheap side-effect-free read doubles as a
 * readiness long-poll. This module owns that probe loop plus the persistence
 * shape; the Zustand store (`stores/agent-provisioning.ts`) wires it to the
 * real engine client, toast, and localStorage.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free so `node --test` can exercise it directly: the imports
 * below are a type (erased at runtime) and the pure key factory.
