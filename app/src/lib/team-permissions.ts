 * rule and re-exported from it, so callers keep importing them from the one
 * team model.
 *
 * Each answers the same question twice, because there are two backends: with no
 * `server` facts the team is a LOCAL sidebar group and the rules are the ones
 * that shipped before C13 (only the virtual default team is special); with them
 * the SERVER's `owner`/`joined` decide, and the client never re-derives either
 * (an org owner/admin reads `owner: true` on every team; everyone reads
 * `joined: true` on the default one). Affordance gates only — the gateway is
 * the sole enforcer, and every one of these rejections is also handled as an
 * expected state (`agent-team-errors.ts`).
