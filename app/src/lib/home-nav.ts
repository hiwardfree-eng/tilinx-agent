/**
 * HOME: where the app opens, and where every fallback lands.
 *
 * There is no global mission board any more — every board belongs to a team —
 * so "home" is the FIRST team's Mission Control. The one exception is a caller
 * with no teams resolved yet (first paint, a workspace still loading, a space
 * with nothing in it): there is no board to send them to, so they land on the
 * Agents home, the screen that needs no team.
 *
 * Every fallback in the app routes through here rather than naming a view of
 * its own: the dead-view guard, the blocked-team guard, ⌘N and the palette off
 * a board, an agent no team claims, Settings > Help, and the tour. One rule,
 * one place, so they can never drift into landing users somewhere different.
