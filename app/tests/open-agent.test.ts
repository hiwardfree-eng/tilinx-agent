/**
 * The two dishonest fallbacks in `lib/open-agent.ts`, and the one-shot it used
 * to leave armed.
 *
 * `open-agent.ts` is the IMPERATIVE half of the agent-nav rules (the pure half
 * is `lib/agent-nav.ts`, covered in `agent-nav.test.ts`). It cannot be imported
 * here: its store chain reaches `lib/tauri.ts` → `@tilinx-ai/engine-client`,
 * whose parameter properties Node's strip-only TypeScript refuses, and
 * `lib/i18n.ts`, whose locale JSON is imported without an import attribute.
 * Both are Vite's job, not Node's. So the store primitive this module now leans
 * on is exercised for real, the wiring that calls it is pinned against the
 * source (the same idiom as `ai-hub-review-fixes.test.ts` /
 * `provider-statuses-gate.test.ts`), and the copy is pinned against the
 * locale files.
