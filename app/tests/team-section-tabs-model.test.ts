/**
 * The team strip's LABELLED lozenges. The rail draws no section rows any more,
 * so the strip is the ONLY way between a team's sections, which makes one
 * property the whole test: the labelled run IS `visibleTeamSectionsForTeam`,
 * in order, minus the board. A run that added a lozenge would offer a section
 * the view refuses to render; one that dropped a section would strand it with
 * no door at all.
 *
 * The board is the exception ON PURPOSE: the team's own lozenge stands for it,
 * so the word "Tasks" appears nowhere in the chrome.
