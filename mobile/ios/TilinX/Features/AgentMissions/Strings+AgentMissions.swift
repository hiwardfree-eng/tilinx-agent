// Per-agent missions-screen copy. Added as a namespaced extension on the shared
// `Strings` (DesignSystem/Strings.swift) so this surface never edits — or
// collides on — that shared file. Section headers ("Needs you" / "Running" /
// "Done"), the Archived row, the composer, and the Rename / Archive action labels
// all reuse the existing desktop-exact copy (`Strings.Board.*` /
// `Strings.MissionControl.*`); only the Delete confirmation is new here.
//
// The Delete confirmation has no desktop dialog to mirror (desktop deletes from
// a per-card icon without a modal), so the copy below is product-voice — no
// files/JSON/CLI mentions, no em dash — matching the TilinX voice rules.
