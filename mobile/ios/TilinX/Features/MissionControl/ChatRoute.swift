/// conversation with a known agent but no session yet. The draft's activity is
/// created on the chat's first send (see ``ChatScreenModel``), so `sessionKey`

/// this route's `sessionKey` (`activity-<id>`), or `nil` for a draft. It is
/// opened through the injected `chatViewBuilder` so this module stays decoupled

/// `TilinXApp` (`.environment(\.chatViewBuilder, ...)`); the placeholder below
