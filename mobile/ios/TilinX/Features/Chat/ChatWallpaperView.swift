/// The signature chat wallpaper: `theme.input` overlaid with a sparse,
/// static diagonal lattice of the TilinX helmet glyph at very low contrast —
/// the TilinX-branded answer to WhatsApp's doodle background, whose flat
/// backdrop is the #1 "this isn't a messenger" tell.
///
/// Draws once with `Canvas` (no animation, no timeline): the closure re-runs
/// only when the size or theme changes, so there is no per-frame cost. Geometry
/// comes entirely from ``ChatWallpaperLayout``; the mark is the shared
/// `HelmetShape`, never a hand-drawn path. Under Reduce Transparency the pattern
/// is dropped for a flat background (``ChatWallpaperVisibility``).
///
/// Purely decorative and hidden from assistive tech; place it behind the feed
/// (e.g. as a `.background { }`), where it bleeds under the composer material.
