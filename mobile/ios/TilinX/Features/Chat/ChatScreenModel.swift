/// ## Draft mode
/// A draft chat opens with a known `agentId` but no `conversationId` — an empty
/// feed with the composer active. The activity is created ON FIRST SEND, exactly
/// mirroring the desktop's `createMission` (`app/src/lib/create-mission.ts`):
/// `activities/create` (fallback title) → `turns/send` → bind the now-real
/// `conversation/<agentPath>/<sessionKey>` scope and observe it as a normal chat.
/// A create-or-send failure rolls the activity back (`activities/delete`) and
/// restores the draft text so the user can retry — no silent failure, no orphan.
