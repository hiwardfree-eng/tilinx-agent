/// The signed-in shell: a three-tab bar — Agents, Mission Control, Settings.

/// Starting a new mission is a top-of-screen compose action on both the Agents
/// tab and Mission Control (their `square.and.pencil` toolbar buttons open the
/// agent picker, then an empty draft chat), not a tab — so this shell is a plain
/// `TabView` with no intercepted center action.
///
/// The Mission Control tab item carries a native badge fed by ``BadgeModel``
/// (the aggregate `needs_you` count across agents — see `PARITY.md` §4). That
/// is a count of missions that FINISHED and are waiting for the user to review
/// and close them, not of missions blocked on an answer: nothing routes itself
/// to `done` any more, so the badge is by design the user's review queue.
