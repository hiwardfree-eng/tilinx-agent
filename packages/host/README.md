# @tilinx/host

Open TilinX host. One frontend-facing server for both deployment profiles:
local desktop/web and cloud. It owns the protocol v3 router, auth seam, domain
routes, scheduler, event stream, credential serve, integrations proxy, and the
ports that hide deployment-specific adapters.

Everything here is OPEN and deployment-agnostic. The closed multi-tenant cloud
adapters (`@tilinx/host-cloud`) were retired and deleted — the shipped cloud is
a private gateway plus one engine pod per agent running this same host — and any
private deployment glue builds against the ports and the `"./src/*"` exports
subpath from outside this repo. See `BOUNDARY.md`.

The package is pnpm-managed and frontend-agnostic. Bun is not required for dev,
tests, or Docker runtime; it is only used by `scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh` when
compiling the desktop host-sidecar binary.

## Shape

```
src/
  server.ts            createControlPlaneServer; shared HTTP router
  ports.ts             WorkspaceStore, RuntimeChannel, CredentialStore, Vfs seams
  domain/              workspace, agent, access types
  routes/              account, agents, data families, skills, portable, integrations
  local/               local profile entry + FS/subprocess adapters
  store/               open memory/local workspace stores
  credentials/         file/memory credential stores + sandbox-token vault
  turn/                per-turn dispatch helpers, quota, attachments, files
  events/              /v1/events hub
  watch/               local FS watcher -> TilinXEvent
  schedule/            routine scheduler + firer
  integrations/        Composio REST integration provider port + adapter
  vfs/                 open Vfs port + memory/FS adapters
```

The exported builder is still named `createControlPlaneServer`; renaming the
internal symbol is tracked in `convergence/follow-ups.md`.

## Design Rules

- Runtime stays single-workspace and tenancy-free. The host owns identity,
  routing, credentials, and deployment lifecycle.
- Domain route logic lives once. Local and cloud behavior changes only through
  injected ports and capabilities.
- Open code never imports a cloud library or closed adapter. `pnpm
  check:boundaries` enforces that seam.
- The local profile is the same host server with local adapters: FS store/Vfs,
  subprocess runtime launcher, single-user verifier, in-process bus, and FS
  watcher.

## Run

```bash
pnpm install
cd packages/host
pnpm dev          # local desktop/web host, src/local/main.ts, serves :4318
```

The cloud profile is this same server wired by the private gateway repo's
deployment (one engine pod per agent); there is no in-repo cloud entry point.

See `convergence/README.md` for the full desktop/web + host local dev loop.

## Test

```bash
cd packages/host
pnpm test && pnpm typecheck
```

See `convergence/README.md` for architecture and parity gates.
