 * runtime fetch and fanned out to this conversation's subscribers, with the
 * same sequencing + snapshot/sync/resume semantics as the runtime's own bus
 * (shared ReplayLog + reducer — see relay-channel.ts, which owns the stream
 * state; this class owns the one-turn-per-agent pump gate).
 *
 * One turn per AGENT at a time (the runtime hydrates/syncs whole-agent state,
 * so concurrent turns would race the workspace).
 *
 * Replica-safety: all cross-request state rides the TurnBus — the inflight
 * gate is a bus mutex with a heartbeat lease, sequenced frames broadcast on a
 * bus channel (so a subscriber on replica B sees a turn pumped on replica A),
 * cancel is a bus message the owning replica acts on, and the snapshot (with
 * its seq watermark) is a bus key.
