/**
 * WHERE a person's yes becomes a receipt: on their own message, as it passes
 * through the host on its way to the runtime.
 *
 * This is the whole reason the lock lives in the host. A runtime cannot author a
 * user message — assistant text never travels this route, and an unattended turn
 * (a routine) is fired straight at the runtime, bypassing it entirely — so a
 * receipt written here is one a person actually clicked for.
 *
 * Two things happen, in this order:
 * 1. Every approval the message carries is recorded against the request it
 *    names, if that request is still live for THIS agent and conversation.
 * 2. Every OTHER request for the conversation is retired. A card the user
 *    walked away from (dismissed, `/clear`ed, edited out, or simply replied
 *    past) is gone from their screen, so it must be gone from here: only the
 *    answer that arrived WITH this message survives, to be spent on the turn it
 *    starts.
 *
 * The receipts ride their OWN request field (`approvals`) and never travel
 * further than this seam: the field is dropped before the request continues, so
 * the runtime, the model and the transcript only ever see what the person
 * actually wrote.
