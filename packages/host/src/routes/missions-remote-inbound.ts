/**
 * The mission family on the PER-AGENT surface — `/agents/{id}/missions…`,
 * served for one agent to the caller already authorized for it:
 *
 *   POST /agents/{id}/missions/start   start a mission on this agent's board
 *   GET  /agents/{id}/missions         this agent's board
 *   GET  /agents/{id}/missions/read    one mission's transcript
 *   POST /agents/{id}/missions/status  move a mission on this agent's board
 *
 * WHY it exists: in managed cloud each agent is its own pod, so the personal
 * assistant's `start_mission` cannot reach another agent's board by writing a
 * file — it addresses the gateway, which dispatches here
 * (missions-remote-forward.ts is the other end). Everything a local start does
 * happens on THIS side: the running cap, the row, the reactivity event, the
 * first turn, and the rollback when the turn will not start.
 *
 * The caller is a user (or their assistant acting as them) that the gateway
 * already authorized for this agent, so this route grants no reach of its own.
 * What it must not take on trust is provenance: `origin` is required and its
 * depth is checked here, which is what keeps the board flat when the parent
 * chat lives in a pod this one cannot read.
