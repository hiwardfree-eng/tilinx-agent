/**
 * The RUNTIME-facing mission routes (HMAC sandbox token), PRODUCT-1244 — the
 * agent's `start_mission` / `list_missions` / `update_mission_status` tools
 * call these instead of writing `.tilinx/activity/activity.json` with file
 * tools. Same shape and rationale as routines-sandbox.ts / learnings-sandbox.ts:
 * merge-safe read-modify-writes under the per-doc lock, events on the same
 * channel a UI write fires, and facts the agent must not author (the
 * agent-started marker `origin_session_key`, Teams attribution) stamped here.
 *
 * Every board call takes an optional target `agent` (routes/missions-target.ts):
 * absent it acts on the calling agent's own board, present it acts on the named
 * agent's — how the personal assistant, which keeps no board of its own, puts
 * work where the user can see it.
 *
 * `/sandbox/missions/settle` is the runtime's turn-end report. Board settle is
 * normally CLIENT-side (the SDK folds the terminal frame and PATCHes status) —
 * but a mission the agent started may never have a client observing it, so the
 * runtime reports every turn end and THIS route applies it ONLY to
 * agent-started missions (`origin_session_key` present) that are still
 * `running`. User-created missions keep the client settle path untouched.
