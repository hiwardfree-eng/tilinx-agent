 * HOW MUCH WORK ONE AGENT MAY HAVE OUT AT ONCE, counted on the CALLER's side.

 * that is the wrong subject on its own: a caller that spreads its starts over
 * fifty agents never trips any single board's cap while putting a thousand
 * missions in flight. The subject that has to be capped is the CALLER, so this
 * ledger records what one agent started and refuses the next start once it is
 * already running this many.
 *
 * The count is deliberately per AGENT rather than per turn: a loop that starts
 * work, ends its turn and starts more on the next one is the same runaway.

 * target never reports back, so the caller would either hold the slot forever
 * (one afternoon of legitimate delegation and the agent can never start work
