/**
 * `POST /sandbox/missions/start` (PRODUCT-1244): create a board mission and
 * fire its first turn — the agent-side twin of the app's `createMission` flow,
 * using the SAME per-workspace channel a routine firing uses so the child turn
 * reaches the runtime exactly like a user message (fire-and-forget 202; the
 * runtime queues it behind the workdir lock until the parent turn finishes).
 * Server-stamped facts the agent cannot author: `origin_session_key` (the
 * parent conversation — the agent-started marker) and Teams attribution.
 *
 * An optional `agent` puts the mission on ANOTHER agent's board, exactly as if
 * the user had created it there; an agent in another pod gets the same start
 * over the wire (missions-remote-forward.ts) and runs {@link startMission} on
 * its own side. The two guards keep their own subjects: depth reads the
 * CALLER's board (where the parent chat lives, remote target or not), the cap
 * counts the TARGET's (that is the board being flooded).
