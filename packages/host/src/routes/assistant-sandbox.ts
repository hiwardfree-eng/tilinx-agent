/**
 * The RUNTIME-facing assistant surface (HMAC sandbox token) — what the agent's
 * `tilinx_call` tool proxies through:
 *
 *   POST /sandbox/assistant/pending  raise one approval card's request
 *   POST /sandbox/assistant/call     perform one catalogued operation
 *
 * WHY the host sits in the middle: the runtime is the least-trusted part of the
 * system, so it must never hold the credential that can act on a user's TilinX
 * account, and it must never be the thing that decides an approval happened.
 * The runtime carries only its per-sandbox token; THIS route resolves the named
 * operation against the generated catalog (`assistant/catalog.ts`, fail-closed),
 * enforces the approval receipt for anything destructive (`assistant-operate.ts`
 * + `assistant/approvals.ts`), holds the gateway token, and relays the caller's
 * verified acting identity so the gateway authorizes the real person.
 *
 * Trust posture matches the other `/sandbox/*` proxies, plus one thing they do
 * not need: the decoded claim is SCOPED (`assistant-claim.ts`). Every agent on a
 * desktop holds a valid sandbox token, so authenticating one is not authorizing
 * it — only the personal assistant's own agent reaches these routes.
