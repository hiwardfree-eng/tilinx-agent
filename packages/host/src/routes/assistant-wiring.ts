/**
 * WHERE this deployment performs user-facing TilinX operations — resolved in
 * ONE place, for the HOST alone: its runtime-facing dispatcher
 * (`routes/assistant-sandbox.ts`) and the boot line that names the state. The
 * gateway credential stops here. No runtime this host spawns is ever told the
 * URL or the token: a runtime reaches TilinX operations through
 * `/sandbox/assistant/call` with its own per-agent sandbox token, and the host
 * forwards with the credential resolved below.
 *
 * Two shapes, one rule — the credential IS the switch:
 *  - GATEWAY-FRONTED (a managed cloud pod): the gateway stamps
 *    TILINX_ASSISTANT_CP_URL + TILINX_ASSISTANT_TOKEN into the pod. The
 *    gateway performs the operations; the pod only relays.
 *  - DESKTOP / SELF-HOST: nothing fronts this host, and it serves the very
 *    routes the operation catalog names — so it is its own gateway. The caller
 *    passes `self` (this host's own loopback base URL and the per-boot bearer
 *    it already accepts) and the family is on with nothing for the user to
 *    configure.
 *
 * An explicitly configured env pair always wins: an operator who pointed this
 * host at a real gateway meant it.
