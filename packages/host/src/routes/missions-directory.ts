 *
 *  - DESKTOP / SELF-HOST: every agent lives in this host, so its own store is
 *    the whole directory.
 *  - MANAGED CLOUD: each agent is its own pod, and the assistant's pod holds
 *    only the assistant. Its agents are the ones the GATEWAY lists for the
 *    user (`GET /agents`), reachable through the pod's gateway credential.
 *
 * Both shapes answer the same candidate list, so target resolution
 * (missions-target.ts) never branches on the deployment.
