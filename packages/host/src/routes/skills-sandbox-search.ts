 *
 * That distinction is load-bearing. An agent handed only the enrichable head
 * would confidently report "there's nothing for that" about a tail it was never
 * shown — `mattpocock/skills` sits at rank 6+ on plenty of queries with 300k+
 * installs each. Visibility is bounded by {@link RESULT_LIMIT} alone; every hit

 *
 * WHY several queries instead of one. A skill is findable by the words in its
 * OWN title, not the words the user happened to say: `mattpocock/skills`'
 * `writing-great-skills` (312k installs) is rank 2 for "writing skills" and
 * absent from all 100 hits for "create and improve skills" — the same request,
 * phrased the way a user would. One model-invented phrase is a coin flip, so the
 * tool asks for up to three and the union is what gets judged. (Query LANGUAGE
 * is the other half of that failure and is fixed in the tool's parameter
 * description: the catalog is English-only, and a Spanish query returns
 * unrelated rows even when a perfect skill exists.)
 *
 * Enrichment is best-effort per skill: a SKILL.md that can't be located (moved,
 * renamed, private) still returns as a hit without a description rather than
 * failing the whole search — the agent can then judge it on name and installs,
 * which is exactly what it would have had anyway. Un-enriched tail hits are
 * returned the same way, so ranking, not fetch budget, decides what the agent
 * can consider.
