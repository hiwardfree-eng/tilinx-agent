 * THE GUARD THE DENYLIST NEEDS.

 * `runtimeParentEnv` strips a listed set, so a TilinX variable nobody thought
 * about is INHERITED by every runtime this host spawns — a model-directed
 * process — and the next host-only credential added anywhere in this package
 * would reach it silently. The runtime's own needs cannot be enumerated from
 * here (provider keys, proxy/certificate variables, PATH, locale), so the
 * allowlist that would replace the denylist is not writable; what IS
 * enumerable is every `TILINX_*` / `COMPOSIO_*` name this package reads.
 *
 * This scans the host sources for those names and requires each to be
 * classified exactly once: withheld (HOST_ONLY) or deliberately shared
 * (RUNTIME_PASS_THROUGH). A new variable fails here until somebody decides.
