# @tilinx/sdk

The **single headless TilinX client** — one client implementation that sits
under every surface: web, desktop (Tauri), and native (iOS/Android via a bridge).
No UI, no framework. Reactive state in, commands out. React bindings live behind
the `./react` subpath; everything else here is framework-agnostic.

Why one client? Every surface used to grow its own fetch/cache/state glue and
drift. `@tilinx/sdk` collapses that into a single kernel + typed modules, so a
behaviour is implemented once and observed identically everywhere.

> **Changing client behavior?** Follow procedure a of the three-surface
> maintenance contract (root `CLAUDE.md` → "Client-surface changes (SDK first)").
> A VM-snapshot change is a contract change — additive only, same discipline as
> protocol v3.

## Ports (injected capabilities)

The kernel never touches a global directly. Every side effect arrives through
`SdkPorts`, so the same code runs in a browser, a native bridge, an SSR worker,
or a test:

| Port | Shape | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fetch` | `typeof fetch` | HTTP/SSE transport for the engine client |
| `storage` | `KeyValueStore` (`get`/`set`/`delete`, async) | persistent strings (tokens, prefs) |
| `clock` | `Clock` (`now`/`setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`) | time + scheduling, mockable |
| `logger` | `SdkLogger` (`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`) | structured, leveled diagnostics |

`SdkConfig = { baseUrl, ports }` is everything needed to construct a `TilinXSdk`.

Browser-safe: no `node:*` imports. Boundary-safe: this is an OPEN package — it
imports no `cloud` code.

## The model — scopes, snapshots, commands

**Reads are snapshots keyed by scope.** A scope is a string address for a
reactive surface. As built, the four modules own these scopes:

| Module | Scope | Snapshot (view-model) | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| session | `"connection"` | `ConnectionViewModel` `{ status, baseUrl, hasToken }` | `session/setToken` |
| agents | `"agents"` | `AgentsViewModel` `{ loaded, items[] }` | `agents/refresh` · `create` · `rename` · `delete` |
| conversations | `"conversations/<agentId>"` | `ConversationListVM` `{ loaded, items[] }` (the LIST) | `conversations/refresh` · `rename` · `delete` |
| turns | `"conversation/<id>"` | `ConversationVM` `{ feed[], running, sessionStatus }` (the live feed) | `turns/send` · `turns/cancel` |

Note the conversations module owns the per-agent LIST scope
(`conversations/<agentId>`); the turns module owns each conversation's live feed
VM (`conversation/<id>`) — two different scopes, no collision.

A module owns a scope and `publish`es the WHOLE new value on every change.
Consumers `getSnapshot(scope)` for the current value and `subscribe(scope, cb)`
for changes. There is also a global one-shot event channel (`on(cb)` /
`SdkEvent`) for signals that are not themselves reactive state.

**Writes are commands.** A command is a JSON `CommandEnvelope`
(`{ id, type, payload? }`) that resolves to a JSON `CommandResult`
(`{ id, ok: true, value? }` or `{ id, ok: false, error }`). Handlers register
once into a shared registry (duplicate `type` throws — a wiring bug, not
last-writer-wins).

**Two callers, one implementation.** Ergonomic typed facade methods
(`sdk.agents.…`) and the serialized bridge path (`sdk.dispatch(envelope)`) hit
the *same* registered handler. Native shells serialize an envelope; in-process
callers use the facade; neither duplicates write logic.

Everything crossing `getSnapshot` / `subscribe` / `dispatch` / `on` is plain
JSON — no functions, no class instances — so it survives a structured-clone or
native-bridge boundary unchanged.

### Why snapshots, not patches

TilinX's event rates are UI-scale (a human chatting with agents), not
high-frequency telemetry. At that scale "publish the latest whole value, latest
wins" is dramatically simpler than maintaining a diff/patch protocol with
sequence reconciliation, and it removes an entire class of desync bugs.
Simplicity wins here. **Roadmap:** if a scope ever grows large enough that
re-sending it per change hurts, we revisit *that scope* with incremental
patches — the `publish(scope, snapshot)` API is deliberately the only thing a
patch layer would sit behind.

## Shape

```
src/
  ports.ts           # SdkConfig + injected capability ports
  store.ts           # ScopeStore — snapshots + event channel (the read side)
  commands.ts        # CommandEnvelope/Result + CommandRegistry (the write side)
  auth-expiry.ts     # shared 401 → session/tokenExpired notifier (one per SDK)
  module-context.ts  # ModuleContext handed to every module factory
  sdk.ts             # TilinXSdk — composes store + per-agent clients + modules
  index.ts           # public entry (kernel + each module's contract)
  modules/           # session, agents, conversations, turns
  react/             # React bindings (exported as @tilinx/sdk/react)
  bridge/            # native-bridge dispatcher + embeddable bundle (see below)
```

Modules are internal: `TilinXSdk`'s constructor composes each
`create<Name>Module(ctx)`, which registers command handlers and returns a typed
facade exposed as a property (`sdk.session`, `sdk.agents`, …). The `ctx`
({@link ModuleContext}) threads one shared store, a memoized per-agent engine
client resolver (`clientFor(agentId)` — the host nests routes under
`/agents/<id>`), and the shared auth-expiry notifier, so every module speaks the
same transport and emits one canonical `session/tokenExpired` signal. Tear the
SDK down with `sdk.dispose()` (stops the agents, activities, and conversation
reactivity streams plus every in-flight turn stream). Native clients receive
`ConversationsChanged` through the turns module: subscribed conversation VMs
reload their persisted history, including after an idle observer has closed.

## Native bridge — embedding the SDK in a mobile host

`bridge/` is the JS side of the native bridge: it lets an iOS (JavaScriptCore)
or Android (Hermes) shell run this exact SDK behind a string message pipe. The
full wire contract — every message shape, ordering guarantee, error surface, and
the normative host-polyfill list — is **`BRIDGE.md`**; this is the how-to.

**In-process (tests, web tooling):** import the dispatcher directly.

```ts
import { createBridge } from "@tilinx/sdk";
import { TilinXSdk } from "@tilinx/sdk";

const bridge = createBridge((config) => new TilinXSdk(config), (msg) => sendToNative(msg));
bridge.receive(inboundJsonString); // deliver one host→SDK message; never throws
// … later …
bridge.dispose();
```

**Embedded (the real mobile host):** build the self-contained IIFE and load it
into the JS engine.

```bash
pnpm --filter @tilinx/sdk build:bridge   # → dist/tilinx-sdk.bridge.js (gitignored)
```

```js
// inside the engine, after loading the bundle:
const bridge = TilinXSdkBridge.create({ send: (msg) => postToNative(msg) });
// first inbound message is always `configure`; the bridge replies `ready`:
bridge.receive(JSON.stringify({ kind: "configure", baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:4317" }));
// then attach the session token, subscribe to scopes, dispatch commands (BRIDGE.md §6).
```

The host implements two primitives: `send(msg: string)` (marshal outbound to
native and return — never call `receive` re-entrantly, BRIDGE.md §8) and calls
`receive(msg: string)` for each inbound message on one thread. The host also
services the native ports the SDK needs over the same pipe — `fetch/*` (it does
the HTTP, streaming the body back as base64 chunks) and `storage/*` (Keychain /
SecureStore) — see BRIDGE.md §9. The bundle self-shims `Headers`, `Request`,
`AbortController`, and `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`; the host need only provide
`setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`/`setInterval`/`clearInterval` (BRIDGE.md §10). The
built bundle is ~33 KiB minified and NOT committed — the iOS/Android build runs
`build:bridge`.

## Out of scope for v1

Deliberately not built yet (add when a real surface needs them):

- **Push port** — no server-push/WebSocket capability port; reactivity is engine
  SSE via the injected `fetch` plus snapshot publishes.
- **Offline writes** — no command queue/outbox; commands assume connectivity and
  fail with `ok: false` when the engine is unreachable.
- **Full control-plane migration** — the SDK wraps the conversation/agent surface
  first; broader control-plane operations stay on their current paths until
  migrated deliberately.
- **Native host app** — the JS-side bridge dispatcher + embeddable bundle now
  ship here (`bridge/`, see above), but the actual iOS/Android shell that loads
  the bundle and backs the native ports lives in its own app, not this package.
