/**
 * Assembles {@link SdkPorts} for a bridged session and routes the host's port
 * replies back to the ports that issued the requests.
 *
 * - **fetch** and **storage** are native, backed by {@link FetchPort} /
 *   {@link StoragePort} over the pipe. `fetch` is wrapped with the SDK's own
 *   {@link createAuthFetch} exactly as the documented host wiring prescribes, so
 *   the session token is stamped per request and 401s are classified.
 * - **clock** is NOT bridged. It reads the JS engine's own `setTimeout` /
 *   `clearTimeout` / `Date.now` — the host already polyfills the global timers
 *   against its native run loop, and the resume/backoff loops in
 *   `@tilinx/runtime-client` schedule against those globals directly. Bridging
 *   the clock would add a message round-trip to every backoff tick and watchdog
 *   sweep for no benefit, so timers stay in-engine.
 * - **logger** forwards each line outbound as a `log` message.
