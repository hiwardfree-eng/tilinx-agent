/**
 * The integrations module's no-refetch writes + the gateway session/notice ops
 * a host needs that have no refetching facade sibling.
 *
 * `writes.disconnect` is the {@link IntegrationsModule.disconnect} write WITHOUT
 * the post-write `refresh()` — for a host that owns its own read model (the web
 * engine-adapter under `reactivity:false`). `setSession` and
 * `dismissReconnectNotice` are new user-scoped gateway calls (no prior SDK
 * equivalent). Every call routes through the shared `run` wrapper so a 401 still
 * surfaces as the SDK's `session/tokenExpired` signal.
 *
 * Kept out of `index.ts` so the module factory there stays within the file-size
 * budget; the refetching facade methods there are untouched (iOS-safe).
