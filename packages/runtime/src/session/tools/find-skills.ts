/**
 * The agent's tools for the OPEN SKILLS DIRECTORY (skills.sh): find a skill for
 * a task, and install the one the user picks (PRODUCT-1238).
 *
 * WHY they exist: users ask TilinX "is there a skill for X?" / "how do I do
 * X?", and until now the only answer was to send them to the Skills page to
 * browse a marketplace themselves. Vercel's popular `find-skills` skill solves
 * this for coding agents, but its procedure is entirely CLI (`npx skills find`,
 * `npx skills add`) — pi ships no tool CLIs, `npx` installs into `~/.claude`
 * rather than the `.agents/skills/` tree pi loads, and TilinX's product prompt
 * forbids naming a CLI to a non-technical user. So the capability is native
 * here instead of installed per agent: every agent has it, on every backend,
 * with no manifest entry and nothing to switch on.
 *
 * Same trust posture as the other host-proxying tools: they hold no secret and
 * carry only the per-sandbox HMAC token, and the host resolves that token to
 * the one agent an install may land in.
