 * - `hidden` — withheld by policy: never listed, described, or called.
 * - `route: null` — the generator could not derive an HTTP call conservatively,
 *   so the host's dispatcher refuses it (`operation_not_supported`). Listing or
 *   describing one would have the agent promise the user an action this build
 *   cannot perform, and the user hears the refusal as TilinX breaking.
