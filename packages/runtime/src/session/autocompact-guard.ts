/**
 * THE AUTOCOMPACT FAILURE GUARD — what keeps a conversation whose compaction
 * cannot succeed from being wedged shut.
 *
 * Compaction is a MODEL CALL, and every backend can refuse one. The Claude
 * Agent SDK backend's summarize-and-restart throws outright when the session
 * holds too little to summarize, when the provider fails, when the summarizer
 * answers with nothing, or when the credential cannot be refreshed
 * (backends/claude/compact.ts); pi's summarizer can be rate-limited the same
 * way (the input-size half of that is handled inside compaction-guard.ts).
 * The context fill only drops on SUCCESS, so an unguarded autocompact turns one
 * refusal into a permanently broken chat: the fill stays over the threshold,
 * the next turn re-enters the same compaction, dies at the same step, and the
 * user can never send another message.
 *
 * So a failed autocompact never fails the turn. It is reported ONCE, the
 * conversation is held off compaction for a cooldown, and the turn runs on
 * against the still-full context — which usually succeeds (the threshold fires
 * at 93% of the window, so there is headroom), and when it does not the user
 * gets the provider's own honest error instead of a summarization failure.
 *
 * `/compact` is deliberately NOT routed through here: a compaction the user
 * asked for must report its failure to the person who asked
 * (conversation-command-run.ts).
