/**
 * What OpenAI's Codex backend actually serves a ChatGPT subscription.
 *
 * pi-ai's baked `openai-codex` catalog is a SUPERSET of what a ChatGPT account
 * can run: it still lists rows OpenAI stopped serving on
 * `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`, and an unserved id is a dead turn
 * ("The model `gpt-5.5` does not exist or you do not have access to it.").
 *
 * Verified 2026-09-07 by POSTing a one-token request to
 * `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` with TilinX's own stored
 * `openai-codex` OAuth credential and the `originator: pi` header pi-ai sends:
 *   served  — gpt-6-astra, gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-5.6-luna,
 *             gpt-5.4-mini, gpt-5.3-codex-spark
 *   refused — gpt-5.5 (404 `model_not_found`), gpt-5.4 (400 "not supported when
 *             using Codex with a ChatGPT account")
 *
 * A LIVE listing exists and TilinX's credential is accepted by it — `GET
 * https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/models?client_version=<codex-cli
 * version>`, the endpoint the Codex CLI caches into `~/.codex/models_cache.json`
 * — and it is deliberately NOT the source here, on evidence gathered the same
 * minute: it returned `gpt-5.5` as `visibility: "list"`, `upgrade: null` while
 * the responses endpoint 404'd that id, and it answers with an EMPTY list unless
 * the query names a Codex CLI version it recognises (`0.153.4` → 9 rows,
 * `0.85.1` → none). It is the CLI's picker list gated on a client version
 * TilinX would have to impersonate forever, not a statement of what the
 * subscription accepts — a listing that is both wrong and fragile is worse than
 * a table whose evidence is written down.
 *
 * Re-verify with that probe whenever pi's catalog moves or a Codex turn fails
 * `model_unavailable`, and edit the set below.
