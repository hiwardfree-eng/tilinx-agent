# @tilinx/protocol — wire contract v3

The ONE protocol for the TilinX host, every deployment. The frontend talks
ONLY to the host (local profile on 127.0.0.1, cloud profile behind the
host URL). Runtimes are internal components behind the host; their
conversation core (`/version` → `protocol: 2`) is re-served by the host
verbatim under `/v1/agents/:id/conversations/*`.

Consumers: the host (`packages/host`), `@tilinx/runtime-client`
(re-exports the conversation subset), `@tilinx-ai/engine-client` (the UI's
client, rewritten onto this in convergence P2/P6). See `convergence/README.md`.

## Route surface (v3)

```
/v1/health /version /capabilities
/v1/events                                    WS/SSE — global TilinXEvent firehose
/v1/workspaces                                CRUD
/v1/agents                                    CRUD (+ color, rename)
/v1/agents/:id/conversations                  list
/v1/agents/:id/conversations/:cid             PATCH rename · DELETE
/v1/agents/:id/conversations/:cid/messages    GET history · POST send (202)
/v1/agents/:id/conversations/:cid/events      SSE (WireEvent, id-scoped)
/v1/agents/:id/conversations/:cid/cancel      POST
/v1/agents/:id/conversations/:cid/title       POST — LLM title
/v1/agents/:id/files/*                        list/read/write/rename/delete/download
/v1/agents/:id/skills                         list/create/save/delete
/v1/agents/:id/routines                       CRUD + /runs
/v1/agents/:id/activities                     CRUD
/v1/agents/:id/config                         GET/PUT
/v1/providers                                 connect-once: status/login/complete/logout
/v1/integrations                              Composio + future integration providers
/v1/preferences /attachments /portable /store
/sandbox/credential                           runtime-facing (HMAC sandbox token)
/sandbox/integrations                         runtime-facing integration proxy
```

Typed-family list GETs (`activities`, `routines`, `routine_runs`, `learnings`,
and `config`) return an envelope — `{ items, diagnostics }` / `{ config,
diagnostics }` — because agents write these files with file tools: malformed
entries are dropped AND reported, never silently lost (beta policy).

Activity delete is idempotent. `DELETE /v1/agents/:id/activities/:activityId`
returns `200 { ok: true, deleted: boolean }`; a repeated delete of the same
activity is `deleted: false`, not a 404.

Store listings are retained only as a cut/empty surface during convergence.
Rust-CLI-era DTOs (Claude-installer, CLI install sources, worktree/shell) die
with the Rust engine and are deliberately absent. Composio is not a CLI DTO in
v3; it is exposed through the host integration routes above.

## Rules

- Shapes that survived from v1 are field-identical to v1 (wire mirrors the
  on-disk `.tilinx` schemas; snake_case families stay snake_case) so the
  engine-client rewrite is transport-only.
- UI gates affordances on `GET /v1/capabilities`, never on deployment checks.
- Internal code gets no backwards compat: protocol changes land everywhere in
  one PR. User DATA compat is a different rule and lives in migrations.
