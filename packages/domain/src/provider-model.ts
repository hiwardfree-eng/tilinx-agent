/**
 * Legacy → pi provider/model migration (pure, table-driven, no I/O).
 *
 * The Rust-desktop era stored each agent's choice in
 * `~/.tilinx/workspaces/<W>/<A>/.tilinx/config/config.json` as
 * `{ provider, model }` using the OLD names ("openai", bare "opus"/"sonnet",
 * CLI-era model ids). The pi runtime resolves a turn's model from its OWN
 * `settings.json` (`activeProvider` + `models[provider]`) and calls pi-ai's
 * `getModel(provider, id)`. For an id the provider doesn't offer, pi-ai returns
 * `undefined` — which then crashes the turn downstream — so an un-migrated
 * legacy value breaks the agent's first turn with a confusing error. Migrating
 * the id up front (or the runtime's read-time guard, packages/runtime
 * safeGetModel) avoids that.
 *
 * This module maps a stored `(provider, model)` to a `(ProviderId, model)` pi
 * actually accepts:
 *   - provider: "openai" → "openai-codex"; already-valid pi ids pass through;
 *     anything else falls back to the default provider WITH a diagnostic.
 *   - model: if already a valid pi model for the mapped provider, keep it; else
 *     map a known legacy alias to the closest pi id AT THE SAME TIER (never an
 *     auto-upgrade); else fall soft to THAT provider's own default WITH a
 *     diagnostic, and to `""` when it has none.
 *
 * The catalog/alias tables live in `provider-model-catalog.ts`.
