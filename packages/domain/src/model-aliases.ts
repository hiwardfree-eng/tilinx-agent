/**
 * Legacy / CLI-era model id → pi model id, AT THE SAME TIER (never an upgrade).
 * Keyed by the CANONICAL provider so the same bare alias resolves correctly per
 * provider. Only ids that are NOT already in `VALID_MODELS` need an entry here —
 * a still-valid id (e.g. "claude-opus-4-8") is kept verbatim and never consults
 * this table.
 *
 * Anthropic tiers: opus (most capable) / sonnet (balanced) / haiku (fastest).
 * The bare aliases the Claude CLI accepted map to the current pi id at the SAME
 * tier.
 *
 * A LEAF (see `provider-dialect.ts`): exposed as the
 * `@tilinx/domain/model-aliases` subpath so the app reads legacy model ids
 * through this table instead of restating its Anthropic half. Its ONE
 * dependency is the sibling `provider-default-models` leaf, reached through the
 * package's own subpath so both stay loadable under plain
 * `node --experimental-strip-types` — where an extensionless relative specifier
 * does not resolve and a `.ts` one is a type error under this package's
 * emitting tsconfig.
