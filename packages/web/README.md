# TilinX Web (`packages/web`)

Standalone browser build of the TilinX desktop UI. It composes `app/src`
verbatim and swaps Tauri/OS imports for browser shims at build time.

The current target backend is the TilinX host (`packages/host`) over protocol
v3. The legacy Rust-engine connect flow still exists as the default path until
final cutover, but normal convergence work uses host mode.

## Modes

- **Host mode**: `VITE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` is set. `@tilinx-ai/engine-client` is
  aliased to `src/engine-adapter`, the app signs in if Firebase (GCIP) env is
  present, and all domain calls go to the host.
- **External new-engine mode**: `VITE_NEW_ENGINE=1` or `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL` is
  set. The browser shows the new-engine connect screen unless URL/token are
  pre-seeded.
- **Legacy mode**: no host/new-engine env. The old connect screen points at a
  Rust `tilinx-engine` URL + token. Kept only until final cutover.

## Running in dev

Run `pnpm dev` from the repo root — the ONE entry point. Its `web` pane serves
this package on http://localhost:1430 against the local Go gateway (cloud
profile: real sign-in, multiplayer).
Do not run this package's `dev` script directly; outside the pane's env it
boots a differently-configured app, which is the drift `pnpm dev` exists to
prevent.

## How It Works

```
src/
  main.tsx          chooses host/new-engine/legacy mode from env
  cloud-login.tsx   host-mode auth wrapper
  app-tree.tsx      app/src providers + gates + <App />
  engine-adapter/   v3 host adapter for @tilinx-ai/engine-client
  new-engine/       external-host connect screen + app wrapper
  shims/            @tauri-apps/* browser equivalents
  admin/            cloud operator dashboard mounted at /admin
```

Host mode covers workspaces, agents, chat, board, skills, routines, files,
providers, preferences, attachments, portable agents, integrations, the Agent
Store, and global `/v1/events` reactivity.

The Agent Store is fully wired here, not stubbed:

- **Browse** — `ui/engine-client/src/store-catalog.ts`. Anonymous, CORS-open
  catalog reads against the store gateway, so browsing works signed-out.
- **Install** — `engine-adapter/portable-from-store.ts`. Prefers the host's
  `/v1/portable/fetch-from-store`; hosted deployments have no local host (the
  cloud gateway answers 501 for `/v1/portable*`), so the browser falls back to
  reading the public IR off the store gateway and converting it with the same
  shared code the host route runs. Either path parks the package in the registry
  a file upload uses, so the wizard steps downstream are identical.
- **Publish** — `engine-adapter/portable-store.ts` + `store-gateway.ts`. Posts
  the agent IR to the gateway `/v1/agentstore` API with the user's own session
  bearer (no manage tokens), reusing the engine transport's 401-refresh discipline.

## Optional Env

- `VITE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` / `VITE_CP_DEV_TOKEN` — host-mode endpoint + dev token.
- `VITE_NEW_ENGINE` / `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL` / `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN` — external
  new-engine mode.
- `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — account sign-in for cloud host mode.
- `VITE_AGENTSTORE_GATEWAY_URL` — store gateway for the public catalog reads.
  There is no production fallback: a build without it has no store, loudly.
- `VITE_AGENTSTORE_SITE_URL` — public store site for "browse the store" links
  (defaults to the production site).
- `POSTHOG_KEY` / `POSTHOG_HOST` — analytics.
- `SENTRY_DSN` — error reporting.

Auth storage mode is forced to `browser`; a browser tab has no OS keychain.

## Browser Equivalents And Limits

Browser shims implement external-link open, desktop notifications, and portable
agent import/export via Blob download and file input.

Desktop-only actions surface a clear error if triggered: reveal in Finder, open
file or terminal, pick local directory, native app update, and local log files.

`Report Bug` works in cloud host mode by posting the desktop payload to the
host's `POST /feedback` route, which files Linear server-side. Outside cloud host
mode it stays desktop-only.

## Installable (PWA)

The web app installs to a phone or desktop home screen with the TilinX icon:
`public/manifest.webmanifest` (name, standalone display, 192/512 `any` +
`maskable` icons) plus the `apple-touch-icon` / `apple-mobile-web-app-*` head
tags in `index.html`, which are what iOS Safari's "Add to Home Screen" reads.
The icons are renders of the opaque iOS app icon
(`app/src-tauri/icons/ios/AppIcon-512@2x.png`); regenerate them from that file
if the brand mark changes. There is deliberately no service worker: the bundle
is served `no-cache` so every launch runs the current release, and an offline
cache would only serve stale chunks against a live host. `tests/pwa-manifest.test.ts`
pins the contract.

## Parity Guard

`scripts/check-tauri-shims.mjs` runs during `typecheck` and `build`. It fails if
`app/src` imports a new Tauri module or invokes a new native command that this
package has not shimmed.

## Relationship To Other Frontends

- `app/` — Tauri desktop app, same React tree plus native shell.
- `packages/web` — same UI in a browser tab, backed by the host.

`mobile/` and `tilinx-relay/` were removed in the convergence.
