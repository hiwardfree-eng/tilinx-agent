/**
 * The web engine-adapter's single {@link TilinXSdk} construction point
 * (migration wave 1).
 *
 * TilinX's behavior — agents/activities/providers/integrations/preferences
 * CRUD, turn lifecycle, reconnection — is written ONCE in `@tilinx/sdk` and
 * every surface binds to it (the iOS app already consumes ALL of it via the
 * native bridge). The web adapter still RE-implements the control-plane CRUD in
 * `control-plane.ts` + `client.ts` against the same routes — a dual source of
 * truth this migration removes. This file builds the ONE web-side `TilinXSdk`
 * that later waves delegate those writes to, so web matches iOS.
 *
 * **Wave 1 is the inert seam.** Construction opens NO network: the SDK is built
 * with `reactivity: false`, so its agents/activities/turns modules do NOT start
 * `/v1/events` streams — web keeps its own read model (TanStack Query) and its
 * own `/v1/events` bus (`client.ts subscribeServerEvents`) unchanged. The SDK
 * exposes only its WRITE surface for wave 2 (`sdk.agents/activities/providers/
 * integrations/preferences` mutations, which hit the SAME gateway routes).
 *
 * **One source of truth for auth + active space.** The `fetch` handed in is the
 * SAME `gatewayAuthFetch` the adapter's own engine client uses: it reads the
 * live Supabase bearer per attempt, retries a 401 after one refresh, and stamps
 * `x-tilinx-org` from the live `ControlPlaneConfig.activeOrgSlug`. Sharing that
 * one fetch means `TilinXClient.setActiveOrg` (which mutates the config in
 * place) reroutes the SDK's calls too, with no extra threading.
