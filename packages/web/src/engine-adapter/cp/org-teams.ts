 * Rename, reorder or restyle a team. Partial: an omitted field is left
 * untouched, so forwarding only what the caller set is the whole contract.
 * `icon`/`color` (C13 §Team identity) have three states: a string SETS, `""`
 * CLEARS, an omitted key leaves alone. `null` is not a clear — it is a `400`,
 * alongside `invalid_icon`/`invalid_color` for a bad shape. Neither is trimmed.
 * `context` is the team's shared prose, not an identity field: any string is
 * valid, `""` is an empty context rather than a CLEAR, and it is never
 * trimmed.
 *
 * Confirmed: outward. A rename, a restyle or a note edit lands in front of
 * every teammate at once, and the previous values are not kept.
 * @param teamId The team this acts on, by the id listAgentTeams returns.
 * @param patch Only what changes. A colour is one of TilinX's ten palette
 *   colours or a literal #rrggbb, an empty string clears one, and an omitted
 *   key leaves the field alone. Omit the icon unless the user named one.
