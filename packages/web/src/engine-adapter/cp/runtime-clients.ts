 * Reads ride the SAME transient-retry wrapper the per-agent client uses. This
 * runtime is cold BY DEFINITION — first-run reaches it before anything has ever
 * run — and the host now answers its probe routes (`/providers`,
 * `/providers/usage`, `/auth/status`) with 503 + `Retry-After` while it boots
 * (HOU-1153). Without the wrapper first-run setup took that 503 as a real
 * failure, while an agent probe one route over quietly retried and succeeded.
