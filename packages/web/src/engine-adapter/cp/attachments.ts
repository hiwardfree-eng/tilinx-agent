 * Uploads files to attach to a message.

 * Composer attachments. Upload the dropped files INTO the agent's workspace —
 * its durable, Files-section-visible `uploads/` folder — so the runtime's clamped
 * file tools can Read them during this turn and any later conversation
 * (HOU-706), and return the RELATIVE workspace paths the host stored them at —
 * which the sender encodes verbatim into the message ("Read these attached
 * files: …"). Binary rides as base64 JSON (the host writes the bytes through
 * its Vfs); the agent resolves each path against its workspace root.
 *
 * Folder uploads (HOU-808): a file picked or dropped as part of a folder
 * carries `webkitRelativePath`; we forward it as `relPath` and the host stores
 * the file nested (`uploads/<folder>/…`) so the folder's structure survives.
 * Pods predating folder support ignore the field and store the flat filename —
 * every returned path is still exact, the upload just loses its nesting.
 *
 * `scopeId` is legacy: current hosts ignore it, but engine pods that predate
 * the durable-uploads layout still 400 without it — keep sending it until no
 * pre-HOU-706 pod remains.
 * @assistant group:attachments hidden: binary upload; the composer batches the dropped files and base64 frames them itself.
