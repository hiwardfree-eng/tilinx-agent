/**
 * Drop-in replacement for `@tilinx-ai/engine-client`'s TilinXClient, backed by
 * the new TS engine. Boot/chat/auth map to the new engine; a single synthetic
 * workspace holds localStorage-backed agents, their `.tilinx/**` files, and
 * their boards.
 *
 * The ~100 methods are split into cohesive cluster **mixins** (under `client/`),
 * composed here over ONE shared {@link TilinXClientBase} → {@link AdapterContext}
 * (`client/context.ts`) so `cp`/`engine`/`sdk` and the active-org state have a
 * single source of truth. The public method surface (names + signatures) is
 * unchanged, so every caller is untouched.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO catch-all Proxy: the old adapter masked unknown
 * methods with `async () => []`, a silent-failure hazard. Legacy desktop/Rust
 * methods that don't exist on the host engine now throw explicitly
 * ({@link LegacyUnsupportedMixin}); a genuinely undefined method throws a real
 * TypeError instead of resolving to `[]`.
