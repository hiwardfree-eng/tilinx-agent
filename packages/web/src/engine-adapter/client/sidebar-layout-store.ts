 * `sidebar_layout` preference AND — the whole point — diffs each agent's
 * resolved team context on the PUT to mirror it into that agent's `GROUP.md`
 * (`routes/group-context-sync.ts`). While this adapter kept the layout in
 * `localStorage` only, that fan-out never ran: a team's shared context was
 * stored and never delivered, on every local deployment.
 *
 * **The gateway-fronted cloud does not serve the route** (its `/v1/workspaces/{id}`
 * handler is single-segment, so the layout path 404s), and its teams are
 * SERVER-owned: there the layout is only a per-user ordering overlay (C13) and
 * context reaches agents through the gateway's own pod writes. So it stays on
 * the device, exactly as before.
 *
 * The predicate is `capabilities.profile` — the server describing itself. No
 * build-time flag can stand in: the desktop shell sets `window.__TILINX_CP__`
 * on EVERY delivery path (HOU-546), so `ctx.cp` is non-null for the local
 * sidecar too and says nothing about which server is on the other end.
 *
 * A 404 from either verb DEGRADES the session to `localStorage` (loud once, no
 * toast loop): that is a host predating the route — the stale-sidecar case the
 * original localStorage-only choice defended against. Every other failure
 * surfaces, because a layout write that silently vanished is worse than a toast.
