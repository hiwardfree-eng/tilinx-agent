 * The board READS activities from the host in cloud mode (listActivities →
 * control plane), so a turn's status write MUST reach the host too — a
 * localStorage write (the standalone store) would never show up on the board
 * and the card would hang in "running". Matches by session_key, or the
 * `activity-<id>` convention the board uses for missions with no explicit key.
 *
 * Shared by the chat mixin's `startSession` / `cancelSession` / `loadChatHistory`
 * observe paths, so it takes the {@link AdapterContext} rather than living on any
 * one of them.
