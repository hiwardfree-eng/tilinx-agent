/**
 * HOU-976 personal-only, the URL contract: a credential write NEVER names an
 * account, in any form.
 *
 * WHOSE credential a call resolves to is decided entirely server-side, from the
 * space the request lands in — a team space has no shared AI account, so the
 * write is the acting member's own; a personal space has exactly one. A client
 * that also sent a scope could only restate that or contradict it, and the
 * shipped `?scope=personal` did the second: it churned every recorded/golden
 * request while adding nothing the gateway did not already know.
 *
 * This is a BYTE-IDENTITY test, not a shape test. Every URL below is asserted
 * whole, so a scope re-entering as a query param, a path segment or a second
 * query is a failure whichever form it takes.
