/**
 * The Proxy-stub removal (migration wave 3).
 *
 * The old adapter ended its constructor with a catch-all `Proxy` whose `get`
 * trap returned `async () => []` for ANY method the class didn't define, logging
 * a warning and silently resolving to an empty array. That is a no-silent-failure
 * violation (CLAUDE.md): a real bug — a typo'd method, or a legacy desktop/Rust
 * feature that doesn't exist on the host engine — was masked as "empty result".
 *
 * The Proxy is gone. Legacy methods that don't exist on the TilinX TS host
 * engine now throw an explicit, descriptive error, and a genuinely undefined
 * method is `undefined` (a real TypeError on call) rather than a silent `[]`.
