 * The whole harness in one spec: the full desktop UI boots in the browser, on
 * the host adapter (host mode), against the fake host — past the
 * engine Connect screen, the language picker, and the legal disclaimer — and the
 * files-first board data (`.tilinx/activity/activity.json`) flows through.
 *
 * It is also where the rail's shape is pinned. There is no global Mission
 * Control any more: the top-level rows are the ones that belong to nobody
 * (the Assistant, the Agent Store), then the "My accounts" and "Workspace"
 * bands, then "Your teams", with the Academy and Settings in the footer — and
 * boot lands on the FIRST team's Tasks board.
