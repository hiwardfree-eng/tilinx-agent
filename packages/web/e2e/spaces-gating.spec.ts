/**
 * C8 Spaces gating (HOU-824 / HOU-878): when the host advertises
 * `capabilities.spaces`, Admin exists in personal and team spaces. Personal
 * People offers the shared create-organization face because the space itself
 * is non-invitable. The gate is `canSeeOrganization(caps, activeSpaceIsTeam)`
 * (`app/src/components/organization/org-view-model.ts`), where the active space is
 * a team iff its workspace id is `org:<16-hex>` (`app/src/lib/space-id.ts`).
 *
 * Admin is a TOP-LEVEL screen in the rail's "Workspace" band, so the gate is
 * observed on its rail row. It used to have a twin — the Permissions screen,
 * which shared this gate exactly — but that screen is gone: agent policy is
 * discovered through a team's focused agent screen, whose own gate is per
 * team (`agent-policy.spec.ts`), not per space.
 *
 * On a NON-spaces multiplayer host (legacy Teams v2, exactly one org) there is no
 * personal/team split, so the gate falls through to the members-roster rule and
 * Admin stays visible on the sole workspace — the regression guard below.
 *
 * The spaces-shaped state single-player can't reach is armed via the fake host's
 * `/__test__/capabilities` (`{ spaces:true }`) and `/__test__/workspaces` (team
 * rows the C8 workspaces bridge serves at `GET /v1/workspaces`). See
 * `@tilinx/fake-host` README + `packages/web/e2e/README.md`.
 *
 * The team-space cases drive the REAL switcher UI against the fake host's
 * armed team rows — live since the adapter's `listWorkspaces` bridges the C8
 * workspaces surface (HOU-881).
