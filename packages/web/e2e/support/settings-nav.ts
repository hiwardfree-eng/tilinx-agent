 * by its accessible name inside the rail; English is forced by the boot seed,
 * so the labels are stable (`app/src/locales/en/settings.json`
 * `nav.organization` = "Admin", `shell:sidebar.assistant` = "TilinX").
 * Settings is the exception and keeps its `nav-settings` anchor.
 *
 * Scoped to the WHOLE rail (`sidebar`), not to `agents`: that inner anchor wraps
 * only the "Your teams" band, and the top-level destinations sit above it.
 *
 * Everything BELOW a rail row is scoped through `screen()` — every top-level
 * view is kept alive, so several screens sit in the DOM at once and a bare
 * page-level lookup can match a hidden one.
