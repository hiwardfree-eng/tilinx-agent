 * agent's CONFIGURATION is reached from the focused agent screen.
 * These helpers are the one place those two paths are spelled out, so a spec
 * says what it wants ("open Files", "open this agent's Skills") instead of
 * re-deriving the route.
 *
 * The rail names TEAMS; the tab row names a team's SECTIONS. Nothing in the
 * rail switches sections any more.
 *
 * English is forced by the boot seed, so label selectors are stable.
 *
 * The functional desktop projects use a 1440px-wide viewport deliberately:
 * after the rail takes its space, the team strip remains above its one-row
 * threshold and these helpers exercise the full lozenge grammar. Compact
 * switcher behavior belongs in explicit narrow-viewport specs, rather than
 * becoming the accidental default for every desktop flow.
