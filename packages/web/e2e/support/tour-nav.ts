 * Starting the in-app onboarding the way a user does.

 * control in the rail's FOOTER — the small "?" beside Settings. Selecting it
 * lands the user on home and arms the onboarding overlay (the welcome beat)
 * over the workspace shell. The same overlay is what a first-run boot arms
 * after the survey, so this helper doubles as the "restart onboarding" path.
 *
 * The help trigger carries the `appTour` anchor — the stable handle every
 * helper here addresses it by — and the menu item is then named by its label.
