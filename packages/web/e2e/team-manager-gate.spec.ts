/**
 * A plain org MEMBER who nonetheless MANAGES an agent.
 *
 * Agent configuration belongs to the focused agent screen and is gated per
 * agent. Team configuration belongs to that team's Context and People tabs.
 *
 * This proves the whole rule from the rail down:
 *   - the team holding the agent they manage offers focused agent screen;
 *   - the team whose agents they only USE does not, and neither does the
 *     workspace's own — the rail and the screen read one list per team, so a
 *     row is never a dead link;
 *   - drilling in, they configure the agent they MANAGE, while the agent of the
 *     same team they only use offers no settings door at all.
 *
 * The Teams-shaped state single-player can't reach is armed via the fake host's
 * `/__test__/capabilities` and `/__test__/org`. The two teams are stored sidebar
 * GROUPS, seeded straight into the key the web adapter keeps them under
 * (`engine-adapter/client/workspaces-mixin.ts` — sidebar layout is deliberately
 * localStorage, not host-backed), because a plain member has no "New team"
 * affordance and so cannot build this state through the UI.
