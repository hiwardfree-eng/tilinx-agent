/**
 * SERVER-BACKED agent teams (C13), driven against the real rail and the real
 * focused agent screen.
 *
 * A team stops being one user's sidebar grouping the moment the gateway
 * advertises `agentTeams`: it is a named group of agents AND people inside a
 * shared space, so the client's stored layout degrades to an ordering overlay
 * and every structural question is the server's to answer. That is a different
 * product, and these specs guard the four places a user meets it:
 *
 *   - the rail draws every team the READ returns, and the read returns the ones
 *     you are part of — the filter is the gateway's, not the client's, so a
 *     team of the space that is neither yours nor holds an agent you can see
 *     costs no rail, and no sidebar affordance lets you add yourself to one
 *     (that is the team's own Members card);
 *   - creating a team broadcasts the name the user TYPED, never a placeholder;
 *   - moving an agent between teams is a write, so it can be refused, and a
 *     refusal must undo itself visibly and explain itself calmly;
 *   - "focused agent screen" grows the two surfaces a shared team has and a private
 *     grouping does not: its people, and a per-team configure gate that no
 *     longer follows the caller's org role.
 *
 * Everything here hangs off `POST /__test__/capabilities {agentTeams:true}`.
 * With the capability off the client runs the pre-C13 local backend unchanged,
 * which is what every other sidebar spec in this suite already proves.
