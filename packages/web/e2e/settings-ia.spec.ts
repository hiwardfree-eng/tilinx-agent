/**
 * The rail's information architecture, and what Settings is left holding.
 *
 * Admin is a TOP-LEVEL screen in the rail's "Workspace" band, not a Settings
 * section: it is not a preference and it owns the whole window. Six things must
 * hold, and each of them broke a real user path when it didn't:
 *
 * 1. the rail carries exactly the top-level entries the IA names — the
 *    unlabelled lead run (Assistant, Agent Store), "My accounts"
 *    (Integrations, AI Models) and "Workspace" (Admin, Skills) — with the
 *    Academy, Settings and the help control in the footer;
 * 2. the two rows that band used to carry are GONE from the rail entirely.
 *    **Permissions** listed the space's agents to reach one's settings page,
 *    which every team's focused agent screen already does per team, in every
 *    deployment; **Time worked** is a capability-gated Admin section. Both are
 *    asserted absent by their old names, so resurrecting either fails here;
 * 3. Settings holds ONLY settings: the general group everybody sees, plus
 *    Danger. The guided tour, the Context editors, Time worked, Admin and
 *    Permissions all left, and the "Help" / "Context" / "Support" / "Team"
 *    headings died with them;
 * 4. Admin opens from the rail in ONE click and shows NO back affordance at its
 *    top level — it has no level above it;
 * 5. the rail's Settings entry ALWAYS lands on the index, including from inside
 *    a section — otherwise it is a dead click, since the view is already
 *    `settings`;
 * 6. Settings is the app's ONE identity control. The rail's avatar menu (edit
 *    profile / account settings / send feedback / sign out) was a second door
 *    onto this page, so the index now opens on the signed-in person and carries
 *    the only Sign out in the product.
 *
 * The footer's help control is the seventh: "Guide me" and "Report a problem",
 * the two things a stuck user reaches for, behind one "?" beside the gear —
 * neither of them a destination, which is why neither is a rail row.
 */
