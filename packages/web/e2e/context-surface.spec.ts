 * The standing context every agent loads before it starts a turn — and the two
 * homes it has, one per OWNER of the words.
 *
 *  - **About me** — what the agents know about the PERSON. They set it once
 *    about themselves, so it is a SECTION of Settings, beside their name and
 *    their language. It is ungated: it exists in every deployment, including a
 *    solo desktop install.
 *  - **Admin > Company context** — what the agents know about the COMPANY. It is
 *    shared by everyone in the space, so it is the space owner's: a section of
 *    the Admin dashboard, which is itself gated to a team space and therefore
 *    never appears on a personal/solo install.
 *
 * The underlying data did not move: each half still reads and writes its own
 * slot of the same blob (`WORKSPACE.md` / `USER.md` locally, the org+user blobs
 * in cloud) through `use-workspace-context`.
