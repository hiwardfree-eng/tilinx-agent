/**
 * The personal assistant: a rail row and an infinite 1-on-1 chat behind it.
 *
 * The assistant is an ORDINARY agent conversation reached at an address
 * discovery hands out (`GET /v1/assistant`), so what is worth pinning here is
 * not the chat pipeline (chat.spec.ts owns that) but the three things this
 * surface adds:
 *
 * 1. the rail row leads the unlabelled run and opens a full-window chat;
 * 2. an empty thread introduces the assistant instead of showing skill cards —
 *    a 1-on-1 chat opens on the composer, not on a menu;
 * 3. the conversation creates NO activity, so it never appears as a board card.
 *    That is the whole of "it stays out of the board, unread counts and
 *    mentions": every one of those surfaces reads activity rows.
