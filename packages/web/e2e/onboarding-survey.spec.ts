 *     Answers persist to the account preference, so a reload never re-asks.
 *   - PROFILE COMPLETION — the in-app prompt for someone who answered the job
 *     question before the other two existed (the shipped
 *     `tilinx_onboarding_segment` preference, lifted). It asks only the gaps,
 *     and "Not now" is remembered.
