/**
 * C13 agent teams — the STORED team world: the lazily-minted default team, the
 * explicit membership rows, and which team each agent sits in.
 *
 * `cloud/docs/contracts/C13-agent-teams.md` is the authority. Two of its rules
 * shape this module: implicit ownership (an org `owner`/`admin` owns every
 * team) is resolved at read time and NEVER written as a row, and an agent with
 * no row belongs to the default team, which is why {@link teamIdOfAgent} falls
 * back to it and why deleting a team needs no sweep.
 *
 * The caller's EFFECTIVE view of all this is `agent-teams-wire.ts`; the routes
 * are `routes-agent-teams.ts`. This module only reads and writes the shared
 * {@link state}, like its `state-teams.ts` neighbour.
